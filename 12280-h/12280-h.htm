<h3>MASKED BATTERIES</h3>
<br>
<p>It was in the Th&eacute;atre St. Philippe (they had laid a
temporary floor over the parquette seats) in the city we now call
New Orleans, in the month of September, and in the year 1803. Under
the twinkle of numberless candles, and in a perfumed air thrilled
with the wailing ecstasy of violins, the little Creole capital's
proudest and best were offering up the first cool night of the
languidly departing summer to the divine Terpsichore. For summer
there, bear in mind, is a loitering gossip, that only begins to
talk of leaving when September rises to go. It was like hustling
her out, it is true, to give a select <i>bal masqu&eacute;</i> at
such a very early--such an amusingly early date; but it was fitting
that something should be done for the sick and the destitute; and
why not this? Everybody knows the Lord loveth a cheerful giver.</p>
<p>And so, to repeat, it was in the Th&eacute;atre St. Philippe
(the oldest, the first one), and, as may have been noticed, in the
year in which the First Consul of France gave away Louisiana. Some
might call it "sold." Old Agricola Fusilier in the rumbling pomp of
his natural voice--for he had an hour ago forgotten that he was in
mask and domino--called it "gave away." Not that he believed it had
been done; for, look you, how could it be? The pretended treaty
contained, for instance, no provision relative to the great family
of Brahmin Mandarin Fusilier de Grandissime. It was evidently
spurious.</p>
<p>Being bumped against, he moved a step or two aside, and was
going on to denounce further the detestable rumor, when a
masker--one of four who had just finished the contra-dance and were
moving away in the column of promenaders--brought him smartly
around with the salutation:</p>
<p>"<i>Comment to y&eacute;, Citoyen Agricola!</i>"</p>
<p>"H-you young kitten!" said the old man in a growling voice, and
with the teased, half laugh of aged vanity as he bent a baffled
scrutiny at the back-turned face of an ideal Indian Queen. It was
not merely the <i>tutoiement</i> that struck him as saucy, but the
further familiarity of using the slave dialect. His French was
unprovincial.</p>
<p>"H-the cool rascal!" he added laughingly, and, only half to
himself; "get into the garb of your true sex, sir, h-and I will
guess who you are!"</p>
<p>But the Queen, in the same feigned voice as before,
retorted:</p>
<p>"<i>Ah! mo piti fils, to pas connais to zancestres?</i> Don't
you know your ancestors, my little son!"</p>
<p>"H-the g-hods preserve us!" said Agricola, with a pompous laugh
muffled under his mask, "the queen of the Tchoupitoulas I proudly
acknowledge, and my great-grandfather, Epaminondas Fusilier,
lieutenant of dragoons under Bienville; but,"--he laid his hand
upon his heart, and bowed to the other two figures, whose smaller
stature betrayed the gentler sex--"pardon me, ladies, neither Monks
nor <i>Filles &agrave; la Cassette</i> grow on our family
tree."</p>
<p>The four maskers at once turned their glance upon the old man in
the domino; but if any retort was intended it gave way as the
violins burst into an agony of laughter. The floor was immediately
filled with waltzers and the four figures disappeared.</p>
<p>"I wonder," murmured Agricola to himself, "if that Dragoon can
possibly be Honor&eacute; Grandissime."</p>
<p>Wherever those four maskers went there were cries of delight:
"Ho, ho, ho! see there! here! there! a group of first colonists!
One of Iberville's Dragoons! don't you remember great-great
grandfather Fusilier's portrait--the gilded casque and heron
plumes? And that one behind in the fawn-skin leggings and shirt of
birds' skins is an Indian Queen. As sure as sure can be, they are
intended for Epaminondas and his wife, Lufki-Humma!" All, of
course, in Louisiana French.</p>
<p>"But why, then, does he not walk with her?"</p>
<p>"Why, because, Simplicity, both of them are men, while the
little Monk on his arm is a lady, as you can see, and so is the
masque that has the arm of the Indian Queen; look at their little
hands."</p>
<p>In another part of the room the four were greeted with, "Ha, ha,
ha! well, that is magnificent! But see that Huguenotte Girl on the
Indian Queen's arm! Isn't that fine! Ha, ha! she carries a little
trunk. She is a <i>Fille &agrave; la Cassette!</i>"</p>
<p>Two partners in a cotillion were speaking in an undertone,
behind a fan.</p>
<p>"And you think you know who it is?" asked one.</p>
<p>"Know?" replied the other. "Do I know I have a head on my
shoulders? If that Dragoon is not our cousin Honor&eacute;
Grandissime--well--"</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute; in mask? he is too sober-sided to do such a
thing."</p>
<p>"I tell you it is he! Listen. Yesterday I heard Doctor Charlie
Keene begging him to go, and telling him there were two ladies,
strangers, newly arrived in the city, who would be there, and whom
he wished him to meet. Depend upon it the Dragoon is Honor&eacute;,
Lufki-Humma is Charlie Keene, and the Monk and the Huguenotte are
those two ladies."</p>
<p>But all this is an outside view; let us draw nearer and see what
chance may discover to us behind those four masks.</p>
<p>An hour has passed by. The dance goes on; hearts are beating,
wit is flashing, eyes encounter eyes with the leveled lances of
their beams, merriment and joy and sudden bright surprises thrill
the breast, voices are throwing off disguise, and beauty's coy ear
is bending with a venturesome docility; here love is baffled, there
deceived, yonder takes prisoners and here surrenders. The very air
seems to breathe, to sigh, to laugh, while the musicians, with
disheveled locks, streaming brows and furious bows, strike, draw,
drive, scatter from the anguished violins a never-ending rout of
screaming harmonies. But the Monk and the Huguenotte are not on the
floor. They are sitting where they have been left by their two
companions, in one of the boxes of the theater, looking out upon
the unwearied whirl and flash of gauze and light and color.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>ch&eacute;rie, ch&eacute;rie!</i>" murmured the little
lady in the Monk's disguise to her quieter companion, and speaking
in the soft dialect of old Louisiana, "now you get a good idea of
heaven!"</p>
<p>The <i>Fille &agrave; la Cassette</i> replied with a sudden turn
of her masked face and a murmur of surprise and protest against
this impiety. A low, merry laugh came out of the Monk's cowl, and
the Huguenotte let her form sink a little in her chair with a
gentle sigh.</p>
<p>"Ah, for shame, tired!" softly laughed the other; then suddenly,
with her eyes fixed across the room, she seized her companion's
hand and pressed it tightly. "Do you not see it?" she whispered
eagerly, "just by the door--the casque with the heron feathers. Ah,
Clotilde, I <i>cannot</i> believe he is one of those
Grandissimes!"</p>
<p>"Well," replied the Huguenotte, "Doctor Keene says he is
not."</p>
<p>Doctor Charlie Keene, speaking from under the disguise of the
Indian Queen, had indeed so said; but the Recording Angel, whom we
understand to be particular about those things, had immediately
made a memorandum of it to the debit of Doctor Keene's account.</p>
<p>"If I had believed that it was he," continued the whisperer, "I
would have turned about and left him in the midst of the
contra-dance!"</p>
<p>Behind them sat unmasked a well-aged pair,
"<i>bredouill&eacute;</i>," as they used to say of the
wall-flowers, with that look of blissful repose which marks the
married and established Creole. The lady in monk's attire turned
about in her chair and leaned back to laugh with these. The passing
maskers looked that way, with a certain instinct that there was
beauty under those two costumes. As they did so, they saw the
<i>Fille &agrave; la Cassette</i> join in this over-shoulder
conversation. A moment later, they saw the old gentleman protector
and the <i>Fille &agrave; la Cassette</i> rising to the dance. And
when presently the distant passers took a final backward glance,
that same Lieutenant of Dragoons had returned and he and the little
Monk were once more upon the floor, waiting for the music.</p>
<p>"But your late companion?" said the voice in the cowl.</p>
<p>"My Indian Queen?" asked the Creole Epaminondas.</p>
<p>"Say, rather, your Medicine-Man," archly replied the Monk.</p>
<p>"In these times," responded the Cavalier, "a medicine-man cannot
dance long without professional interruption, even when he dances
for a charitable object. He has been called to two relapsed
patients." The music struck up; the speaker addressed himself to
the dance; but the lady did not respond.</p>
<p>"Do dragoons ever moralize?" she asked.</p>
<p>"They do more," replied her partner; "sometimes, when beauty's
enjoyment of the ball is drawing toward its twilight, they catch
its pleasant melancholy, and confess; will the good father sit in
the confessional?"</p>
<p>The pair turned slowly about and moved toward the box from which
they had come, the lady remaining silent; but just as they were
entering she half withdrew her arm from his, and, confronting him
with a rich sparkle of the eyes within the immobile mask of the
monk, said:</p>
<p>"Why should the conscience of one poor little monk carry all the
frivolity of this ball? I have a right to dance, if I wish. I give
you my word, Monsieur Dragoon, I dance only for the benefit of the
sick and the destitute. It is you men--you dragoons and others--who
will not help them without a compensation in this sort of nonsense.
Why should we shrive you when you ought to burn?"</p>
<p>"Then lead us to the altar," said the Dragoon.</p>
<p>"Pardon, sir," she retorted, her words entangled with a musical,
open-hearted laugh, "I am not going in that direction." She cast
her glance around the ball-room. "As you say, it is the twilight of
the ball; I am looking for the evening star,--that is, my little
Huguenotte."</p>
<p>"Then you are well mated."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"For you are Aurora."</p>
<p>The lady gave a displeased start.</p>
<p>"Sir!"</p>
<p>"Pardon," said the Cavalier, "if by accident I have hit upon
your real name--"</p>
<p>She laughed again--a laugh which was as exultantly joyous as it
was high-bred.</p>
<p>"Ah, my name? Oh no, indeed!" (More work for the Recording
Angel.)</p>
<p>She turned to her protectress.</p>
<p>"Madame, I know you think we should be going home."</p>
<p>The senior lady replied in amiable speech, but with sleepy eyes,
and the Monk began to lift and unfold a wrapping. As the Cavalier'
drew it into his own possession, and, agreeably to his gesture, the
Monk and he sat down side by side, he said, in a low tone:</p>
<p>"One more laugh before we part."</p>
<p>"A monk cannot laugh for nothing."</p>
<p>"I will pay for it."</p>
<p>"But with nothing to laugh at?" The thought of laughing at
nothing made her laugh a little on the spot.</p>
<p>"We will make something to laugh at," said the Cavalier; "we
will unmask to each other, and when we find each other first
cousins, the laugh will come of itself."</p>
<p>"Ah! we will unmask?--no! I have no cousins. I am certain we are
strangers."</p>
<p>"Then we will laugh to think that I paid for the
disappointment."</p>
<p>Much more of this childlike badinage followed, and by and by
they came around again to the same last statement. Another little
laugh escaped from the cowl.</p>
<p>"You will pay? Let us see; how much will you give to the sick
and destitute?"</p>
<p>"To see who it is I am laughing with, I will give whatever you
ask."</p>
<p>"Two hundred and fifty dollars, cash, into the hands of the
managers!"</p>
<p>"A bargain!"</p>
<p>The Monk laughed, and her chaperon opened her eyes and smiled
apologetically. The Cavalier laughed, too, and said:</p>
<p>"Good! That was the laugh; now the unmasking."</p>
<p>"And you positively will give the money to the managers not
later than to-morrow evening?"</p>
<br>

<b>"She looked upon an unmasked, noble countenance, lifted her own
mask a little,<br>
and then a little more; and then shut it quickly".</b></p>
<br>
<p>"Not later. It shall be done without fail."</p>
<p>"Well, wait till I put on my wrappings; I must be ready to
run."</p>
<p>This delightful nonsense was interrupted by the return of the
<i>Fille &agrave; la Cassette</i> and her aged, but sprightly,
escort, from a circuit of the floor. Madame again opened her eyes,
and the four prepared to depart. The Dragoon helped the Monk to
fortify herself against the outer air. She was ready before the
others. There was a pause, a low laugh, a whispered "Now!" She
looked upon an unmasked, noble countenance, lifted her own mask a
little, and then a little more; and then shut it quickly down again
upon a face whose beauty was more than even those fascinating
graces had promised which Honor&eacute; Grandissime had fitly named
the Morning; but it was a face he had never seen before.</p>
<p>"Hush!" she said, "the enemies of religion are watching us; the
Huguenotte saw me. Adieu"--and they were gone.</p>
<p>M. Honor&eacute; Grandissime turned on his heel and very soon
left the ball.</p>
<p>"Now, sir," thought he to himself, "we'll return to our
senses."</p>
<p>"Now I'll put my feathers on again," says the plucked bird.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE FATE OF THE IMMIGRANT</h3>
<br>
<p>It was just a fortnight after the ball, that one Joseph
Frowenfeld opened his eyes upon Louisiana. He was an American by
birth, rearing and sentiment, yet German enough through his
parents, and the only son in a family consisting of father, mother,
self, and two sisters, new-blown flowers of womanhood. It was an
October dawn, when, long wearied of the ocean, and with bright
anticipations of verdure, and fragrance, and tropical gorgeousness,
this simple-hearted family awoke to find the bark that had borne
them from their far northern home already entering upon the ascent
of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>We may easily imagine the grave group, as they came up one by
one from below, that morning of first disappointment, and stood
(with a whirligig of jubilant mosquitoes spinning about each head)
looking out across the waste, seeing the sky and the marsh meet in
the east, the north, and the west, and receiving with patient
silence the father's suggestion that the hills would, no doubt,
rise into view after a while.</p>
<p>"My children, we may turn this disappointment into a lesson; if
the good people of this country could speak to us now, they might
well ask us not to judge them or their land upon one or two hasty
glances, or by the experiences of a few short days or weeks."</p>
<p>But no hills rose. However, by and by they found solace in the
appearance of distant forest, and in the afternoon they entered a
land--but such a land! A land hung in mourning, darkened by
gigantic cypresses, submerged; a land of reptiles, silence, shadow,
decay.</p>
<p>"The captain told father, when we went to engage passage, that
New Orleans was on high land," said the younger daughter, with a
tremor in the voice, and ignoring the remonstrative touch of her
sister.</p>
<p>"On high land?" said the captain, turning from the pilot; "well,
so it is--higher than the swamp, but not higher than the river,"
and he checked a broadening smile.</p>
<p>But the Frowenfelds were not a family to complain. It was
characteristic of them to recognize the bright as well as the
solemn virtues, and to keep each other reminded of the duty of
cheerfulness. A smile, starting from the quiet elder sister, went
around the group, directed against the abstracted and somewhat
rueful countenance of Joseph, whereat he turned with a better face
and said that what the Creator had pronounced very good they could
hardly feel free to condemn. The old father was still more stout of
heart.</p>
<p>"These mosquitoes, children, are thought by some to keep the air
pure," he said.</p>
<p>"Better keep out of it after sunset," put in the captain.</p>
<p>After that day and night, the prospect grew less repellent. A
gradually matured conviction that New Orleans would not be found
standing on stilts in the quagmire enabled the eye to become
educated to a better appreciation of the solemn landscape. Nor was
the landscape always solemn. There were long openings, now and
then, to right and left, of emerald-green savannah, with the
dazzling blue of the Gulf far beyond, waving a thousand
white-handed good-byes as the funereal swamps slowly shut out again
the horizon. How sweet the soft breezes off the moist prairies! How
weird, how very near, the crimson and green and black and yellow
sunsets! How dream-like the land and the great, whispering river!
The profound stillness and breath reminded the old German, so he
said, of that early time when the evenings and mornings were the
first days of the half-built world. The barking of a dog in Fort
Plaquemines seemed to come before its turn in the panorama of
creation--before the earth was ready for the dog's master.</p>
<p>But he was assured that to live in those swamps was not entirely
impossible to man--"if one may call a negro a man." Runaway slaves
were not so rare in them as one--a lost hunter, for example--might
wish. His informant was a new passenger, taken aboard at the fort.
He spoke English.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir! Didn' I had to run from Bras-Coup&eacute; in de
haidge of de swamp be'ine de 'abitation of my cousin Honor&eacute;,
one time? You can hask 'oo you like!" (A Creole always provides
against incredulity.) At this point he digressed a moment: "You
know my cousin, Honor&eacute; Grandissime, w'at give two hund'
fifty dolla' to de 'ospill laz mont'? An' juz because my cousin
Honor&eacute; give it, somebody helse give de semm. Fo' w'y don't
he give his nemm?"</p>
<p>The reason (which this person did not know) was that the second
donor was the first one over again, resolved that the little
unknown Monk should not know whom she had baffled.</p>
<p>"Who was Bras-Coup&eacute;?" the good German asked in
French.</p>
<p>The stranger sat upon the capstan, and, in the shadow of the
cypress forest, where the vessel lay moored for a change of wind,
told in a <i>patois</i> difficult, but not impossible, to
understand, the story of a man who chose rather to be hunted like a
wild beast among those awful labyrinths, than to be yoked and
beaten like a tame one. Joseph, drawing near as the story was
coming to a close, overheard the following English:</p>
<p>"Friend, if you dislike heated discussion, do not tell that to
my son."</p>
<p>The nights were strangely beautiful. The immigrants almost
consumed them on deck, the mother and daughters attending in silent
delight while the father and son, facing south, rejoiced in learned
recognition of stars and constellations hitherto known to them only
on globes and charts.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear son," said the father, in a moment of ecstatic
admiration, "wherever man may go, around this globe--however
uninviting his lateral surroundings may be, the heavens are ever
over his head, and I am glad to find the stars your favorite
objects of study."</p>
<p>So passed the time as the vessel, hour by hour, now slowly
pushed by the wind against the turbid current, now warping along
the fragrant precincts of orange or magnolia groves or fields of
sugar-cane, or moored by night in the deep shade of mighty
willow-jungles, patiently crept toward the end of their pilgrimage;
and in the length of time which would at present be consumed in
making the whole journey from their Northern home to their Southern
goal, accomplished the distance of ninety-eight miles, and found
themselves before the little, hybrid city of "Nouvelle
Orl&eacute;ans." There was the cathedral, and standing beside it,
like Sancho beside Don Quixote, the squat hall of the Cabildo with
the calabozo in the rear. There were the forts, the military
bakery, the hospitals, the plaza, the Almonaster stores, and the
busy rue Toulouse; and, for the rest of the town, a pleasant
confusion of green tree-tops, red and gray roofs, and glimpses of
white or yellow wall, spreading back a few hundred yards behind the
cathedral, and tapering into a single rank of gardened and
belvedered villas, that studded either horn of the river's crescent
with a style of home than which there is probably nothing in the
world more maternally homelike.</p>
<p>"And now," said the "captain," bidding the immigrants good-by,
"keep out of the sun and stay in after dark; you're not
'acclimated,' as they call it, you know, and the city is full of
the fever."</p>
<p>Such were the Frowenfelds. Out of such a mold and into such a
place came the young Am&eacute;ricain, whom even Agricola Fusilier,
as we shall see, by and by thought worthy to be made an exception
of, and honored with his recognition.</p>
<p>The family rented a two-story brick house in the rue Bienville,
No. 17, it seems. The third day after, at daybreak, Joseph called
his father to his bedside to say that he had had a chill, and was
suffering such pains in his head and back that he would like to lie
quiet until they passed off. The gentle father replied that it was
undoubtedly best to do so, and preserved an outward calm. He looked
at his son's eyes; their pupils were contracted to tiny beads. He
felt his pulse and his brow; there was no room for doubt; it was
the dreaded scourge--the fever. We say, sometimes, of hearts that
they sink like lead; it does not express the agony.</p>
<p>On the second day, while the unsated fever was running through
every vein and artery, like soldiery through the streets of a
burning city, and far down in the caverns of the body the poison
was ransacking every palpitating corner, the poor immigrant fell
into a moment's sleep. But what of that? The enemy that moment had
mounted to the brain. And then there happened to Joseph an
experience rare to the sufferer by this disease, but not entirely
unknown,--a delirium of mingled pleasures and distresses. He seemed
to awake somewhere between heaven and earth, reclining in a
gorgeous barge, which was draped in curtains of interwoven silver
and silk, cushioned with rich stuffs of every beautiful dye, and
perfumed <i>ad nauseam</i> with orange-leaf tea. The crew was a
single old negress, whose head was wound about with a blue Madras
handkerchief, and who stood at the prow, and by a singular rotary
motion, rowed the barge with a teaspoon. He could not get his head
out of the hot sun; and the barge went continually round and round
with a heavy, throbbing motion, in the regular beat of which
certain spirits of the air--one of whom appeared to be a beautiful
girl and another a small, red-haired man,--confronted each other
with the continual call and response:</p>
<p>"Keep the bedclothes on him and the room shut tight, keep the
bedclothes on him and the room shut tight,"--"An' don' give 'im
some watta, an' don' give 'im some watta."</p>
<p>During what lapse of time--whether moments or days--this lasted,
Joseph could not then know; but at last these things faded away,
and there came to him a positive knowledge that he was on a
sick-bed, where unless something could be done for him he should be
dead in an hour. Then a spoon touched his lips, and a taste of
brandy and water went all through him; and when he fell into sweet
slumber and awoke, and found the teaspoon ready at his lips again,
he had to lift a little the two hands lying before him on the
coverlet to know that they were his--they were so wasted and
yellow. He turned his eyes, and through the white gauze of the
mosquito-bar saw, for an instant, a strange and beautiful young
face; but the lids fell over his eyes, and when he raised them
again the blue-turbaned black nurse was tucking the covering about
his feet.</p>
<p>"Sister!"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>"Where is my mother?"</p>
<p>The negress shook her head.</p>
<p>He was too weak to speak again, but asked with his eyes so
persistently, and so pleadingly, that by and by she gave him an
audible answer. He tried hard to understand it, but could not, it
being in these words:</p>
<p>"<i>Li pa' oul&eacute; vini 'ci--li pas capabe</i>."</p>
<p>Thrice a day, for three days more, came a little man with a
large head surrounded by short, red curls and with small freckles
in a fine skin, and sat down by the bed with a word of good cheer
and the air of a commander. At length they had something like an
extended conversation.</p>
<p>"So you concluded not to die, eh? Yes, I'm the doctor--Doctor
Keene. A young lady? What young lady? No, sir, there has been no
young lady here. You're mistaken. Vagary of your fever. There has
been no one here but this black girl and me. No, my dear fellow,
your father and mother can't see you yet; you don't want them to
catch the fever, do you? Good-bye. Do as your nurse tells you, and
next week you may raise your head and shoulders a little; but if
you don't mind her you'll have a backset, and the devil himself
wouldn't engage to cure you."</p>
<p>The patient had been sitting up a little at a time for several
days, when at length the doctor came to pay a final call, "as a
matter of form;" but, after a few pleasantries, he drew his chair
up gravely, and, in a tender tone--need we say it? He had come to
tell Joseph that his father, mother, sisters, all, were gone on a
second--a longer--voyage, to shores where there could be no
disappointments and no fevers, forever.</p>
<p>"And, Frowenfeld," he said, at the end of their long and painful
talk, "if there is any blame attached to not letting you go with
them, I think I can take part of it; but if you ever want a
friend,--one who is courteous to strangers and ill-mannered only to
those he likes,--you can call for Charlie Keene. I'll drop in to
see you, anyhow, from time to time, till you get stronger. I have
taken a heap of trouble to keep you alive, and if you should
relapse now and give us the slip, it would be a deal of good physic
wasted; so keep in the house."</p>
<p>The polite neighbors who lifted their cocked hats to Joseph, as
he spent a slow convalescence just within his open door, were not
bound to know how or when he might have suffered. There were no
"Howards" or "Y.M.C.A.'s" in those days; no "Peabody Reliefs." Even
had the neighbors chosen to take cognizance of those bereavements,
they were not so unusual as to fix upon him any extraordinary
interests an object of sight; and he was beginning most
distressfully to realize that "great solitude" which the
philosopher attributes to towns, when matters took a decided
turn.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>"AND WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR?"</h3>
<br>
<p>We say matters took a turn; or, better, that Frowenfeld's
interest in affairs received a new life. This had its beginning in
Doctor Keene's making himself specially entertaining in an
old-family-history way, with a view to keeping his patient within
doors for a safe period. He had conceived a great liking for
Frowenfeld, and often, of an afternoon, would drift in to challenge
him to a game of chess--a game, by the way, for which neither of
them cared a farthing. The immigrant had learned its moves to
gratify his father, and the doctor--the truth is, the doctor had
never quite learned them; but he was one of those men who cannot
easily consent to acknowledge a mere affection for one, least of
all one of their own sex. It may safely be supposed, then, that the
board often displayed an arrangement of pieces that would have
bewildered Morphy himself.</p>
<p>"By the by, Frowenfeld," he said one evening, after the one
preliminary move with which he invariably opened his game, "you
haven't made the acquaintance of your pretty neighbors next
door."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld knew of no specially pretty neighbors next door on
either side--had noticed no ladies.</p>
<p>"Well, I will take you in to see them some time." The doctor
laughed a little, rubbing his face and his thin, red curls with one
hand, as he laughed.</p>
<p>The convalescent wondered what there could be to laugh at.</p>
<p>"Who are they?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Their name is De Grapion--oh, De Grapion, says I! their name is
Nancanou. They are, without exception, the finest women--the
brightest, the best, and the bravest--that I know in New Orleans."
The doctor resumed a cigar which lay against the edge of the
chess-board, found it extinguished, and proceeded to relight it.
"Best blood of the province; good as the Grandissimes. Blood is a
great thing here, in certain odd ways," he went on. "Very curious
sometimes." He stooped to the floor where his coat had fallen, and
took his handkerchief from a breast-pocket. "At a grand mask ball
about two months ago, where I had a bewilderingly fine time with
those ladies, the proudest old turkey in the theater was an old
fellow whose Indian blood shows in his very behavior, and yet--ha,
ha! I saw that same old man, at a quadroon ball a few years ago,
walk up to the handsomest, best dressed man in the house, a man
with a skin whiter than his own,--a perfect gentleman as to looks
and manners,--and without a word slap him in the face."</p>
<p>"You laugh?" asked Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"Laugh? Why shouldn't I? The fellow had no business there. Those
balls are not given to quadroon <i>males</i>, my friend. He was
lucky to get out alive, and that was about all he did.</p>
<p>"They are right!" the doctor persisted, in response to
Frowenfeld's puzzled look. "The people here have got to be
particular. However, that is not what we were talking about.
Quadroon balls are not to be mentioned in connection. Those
ladies--" He addressed himself to the resuscitation of his cigar.
"Singular people in this country," he resumed; but his cigar would
not revive. He was a poor story-teller. To Frowenfeld--as it would
have been to any one, except a Creole or the most thoroughly
Creoleized Am&eacute;ricain--his narrative, when it was done, was
little more than a thick mist of strange names, places and events;
yet there shone a light of romance upon it that filled it with
color and populated it with phantoms. Frowenfeld's interest
rose--was allured into this mist--and there was left befogged. As a
physician, Doctor Keene thus accomplished his end,--the mental
diversion of his late patient,--for in the midst of the mist
Frowenfeld encountered and grappled a problem of human life in
Creole type, the possible correlations of whose quantities we shall
presently find him revolving in a studious and sympathetic mind, as
the poet of to-day ponders the</p>
<blockquote>"Flower in the crannied wall."</blockquote>
<p>The quantities in that problem were the ancestral--the
maternal--roots of those two rival and hostile families whose
descendants--some brave, others fair--we find unwittingly thrown
together at the ball, and with whom we are shortly to have the
honor of an unmasked acquaintance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>FAMILY TREES</h3>
<br>
<p>In the year 1673, and in the royal hovel of a Tchoupitoulas
village not far removed from that "Buffalo's Grazing-ground," now
better known as New Orleans, was born Lufki-Humma, otherwise Red
Clay. The mother of Red Clay was a princess by birth as well as by
marriage. For the father, with that devotion to his people's
interests presumably common to rulers, had ten moons before
ventured northward into the territory of the proud and exclusive
Natchez nation, and had so prevailed with--so outsmoked--their
"Great Sun," as to find himself, as he finally knocked the ashes
from his successful calumet, possessor of a wife whose pedigree
included a long line of royal mothers--fathers being of little
account in Natchez heraldry--extending back beyond the Mexican
origin of her nation, and disappearing only in the effulgence of
her great original, the orb of day himself. As to Red Clay's
paternal ancestry, we must content ourselves with the fact that the
father was not only the diplomate we have already found him, but a
chief of considerable eminence; that is to say, of seven feet
stature.</p>
<p>It scarce need be said that when Lufki-Humma was born, the
mother arose at once from her couch of skins, herself bore the
infant to the neighboring bayou and bathed it--not for singularity,
nor for independence, nor for vainglory, but only as one of the
heart-curdling conventionalities which made up the experience of
that most pitiful of holy things, an Indian mother.</p>
<p>Outside the lodge door sat and continued to sit, as she passed
out, her master or husband. His interest in the trivialities of the
moment may be summed up in this, that he was as fully prepared as
some men are in more civilized times and places to hold his queen
to strict account for the sex of her offspring. Girls for the
Natchez, if they preferred them, but the chief of the Tchoupitoulas
wanted a son. She returned from the water, came near, sank upon her
knees, laid the infant at his feet, and lo! a daughter.</p>
<p>Then she fell forward heavily upon her face. It may have been
muscular exhaustion, it may have been the mere wind of her
hasty-tempered matrimonial master's stone hatchet as it whiffed by
her skull; an inquest now would be too great an irony; but
something blew out her "vile candle."</p>
<p>Among the squaws who came to offer the accustomed funeral
howlings, and seize mementoes from the deceased lady's scant
leavings, was one who had in her own palmetto hut an empty cradle
scarcely cold, and therefore a necessity at her breast, if not a
place in her heart, for the unfortunate Lufki-Humma; and thus it
was that this little waif came to be tossed, a droll hypothesis of
flesh, blood, nerve and brain, into the hands of wild nature with
<i>carte blanche</i> as to the disposal of it. And now, since this
was Agricola's most boasted ancestor--since it appears the darkness
of her cheek had no effect to make him less white, or qualify his
right to smite the fairest and most distant descendant of an
African on the face, and since this proud station and right could
not have sprung from the squalid surroundings of her birth, let us
for a moment contemplate these crude materials.</p>
<p>As for the flesh, it was indeed only some of that "one flesh" of
which we all are made; but the blood--to go into finer
distinctions--the blood, as distinguished from the milk of her
Alibamon foster-mother, was the blood of the royal caste of the
great Toltec mother-race, which, before it yielded its Mexican
splendors to the conquering Aztec, throned the jeweled and
gold-laden Inca in the South, and sent the sacred fire of its
temples into the North by the hand of the Natchez. For it is a
short way of expressing the truth concerning Red Clay's tissues to
say she had the blood of her mother and the nerve of her father,
the nerve of the true North American Indian, and had it in its
finest strength.</p>

<b>"The daughter of the Natchez sitting in majesty, clothed in
many-colored robes of shining feathers<br>
crossed and recrossed with girdles of serpent-skins and of
wampum".</b></p>
<br>
<p>As to her infantine bones, they were such as needed not to fail
of straightness in the limbs, compactness in the body, smallness in
hands and feet, and exceeding symmetry and comeliness throughout.
Possibly between the two sides of the occipital profile there may
have been an Incaean tendency to inequality; but if by any good
fortune her impressible little cranium should escape the
cradle-straps, the shapeliness that nature loves would soon appear.
And this very fortune befell her. Her father's detestation of an
infant that had not consulted his wishes as to sex prompted a
verbal decree which, among other prohibitions, forbade her skull
the distortions that ambitious and fashionable Indian mothers
delighted to produce upon their offspring.</p>
<p>And as to her brain: what can we say? The casket in which Nature
sealed that brain, and in which Nature's great step-sister, Death,
finally laid it away, has never fallen into the delighted
fingers--and the remarkable fineness of its texture will never
kindle admiration in the triumphant eyes--of those whose scientific
hunger drives them to dig for <i>crania Americana</i>; nor yet will
all their learned excavatings ever draw forth one of those pale
souvenirs of mortality with walls of shapelier contour or more
delicate fineness, or an interior of more admirable spaciousness,
than the fair council-chamber under whose dome the mind of
Lufki-Humma used, about two centuries ago, to sit in frequent
conclave with high thoughts.</p>
<p>"I have these facts," it was Agricola Fusilier's habit to say,
"by family tradition; but you know, sir, h-tradition is much more
authentic than history!"</p>
<p>Listening Crane, the tribal medicine-man, one day stepped softly
into the lodge of the giant chief, sat down opposite him on a mat
of plaited rushes, accepted a lighted calumet, and, after the
silence of a decent hour, broken at length by the warrior's
intimation that "the ear of Raging Buffalo listened for the voice
of his brother," said, in effect, that if that ear would turn
toward the village play-ground, it would catch a murmur like the
pleasing sound of bees among the blossoms of the catalpa, albeit
the catalpa was now dropping her leaves, for it was the moon of
turkeys. No, it was the repressed laughter of squaws, wallowing
with their young ones about the village pole, wondering at the
Natchez-Tchoupitoulas child, whose eye was the eye of the panther,
and whose words were the words of an aged chief in council.</p>
<p>There was more added; we record only enough to indicate the
direction of Listening Crane's aim. The eye of Raging Buffalo was
opened to see a vision: the daughter of the Natchez sitting in
majesty, clothed in many-colored robes of shining feathers crossed
and recrossed with girdles of serpent-skins and of wampum, her feet
in quilled and painted moccasins, her head under a glory of plumes,
the carpet of buffalo-robes about her throne covered with the
trophies of conquest, and the atmosphere of her lodge blue with the
smoke of embassadors' calumets; and this extravagant dream the
capricious chief at once resolved should eventually become reality.
"Let her be taken to the village temple," he said to his
prime-minister, "and be fed by warriors on the flesh of
wolves."</p>
<p>The Listening Crane was a patient man; he was the "man that
waits" of the old French proverb; all things came to him. He had
waited for an opportunity to change his brother's mind, and it had
come. Again, he waited for him to die; and, like Methuselah and
others, he died. He had heard of a race more powerful than the
Natchez--a white race; he waited for them; and when the year 1682
saw a humble "black gown" dragging and splashing his way, with La
Salle and Tonti, through the swamps of Louisiana, holding forth the
crucifix and backed by French carbines and Mohican tomahawks, among
the marvels of that wilderness was found this: a child of nine
sitting, and--with some unostentatious aid from her
medicine-man--ruling; queen of her tribe and high-priestess of
their temple. Fortified by the acumen and self-collected ambition
of Listening Crane, confirmed in her regal title by the white man's
Manitou through the medium of the "black gown," and inheriting her
father's fear-compelling frown, she ruled with majesty and wisdom,
sometimes a decreer of bloody justice, sometimes an Amazonian
counselor of warriors, and at all times--year after year, until she
had reached the perfect womanhood of twenty-six--a virgin
queen.</p>
<p>On the 11th of March, 1699, two overbold young Frenchmen of M.
D'Iberville's little exploring party tossed guns on shoulder, and
ventured away from their canoes on the bank of the Mississippi into
the wilderness. Two men they were whom an explorer would have been
justified in hoarding up, rather than in letting out at such risks;
a pair to lean on, noble and strong. They hunted, killed nothing,
were overtaken by rain, then by night, hunger, alarm, despair.</p>
<p>And when they had lain down to die, and had only succeeded in
falling asleep, the Diana of the Tchoupitoulas, ranging the
magnolia groves with bow and quiver, came upon them in all the
poetry of their hope-forsaken strength and beauty, and fell sick of
love. We say not whether with Zephyr Grandissime or Epaminondas
Fusilier; that, for the time being, was her secret.</p>
<p>The two captives were made guests. Listening Crane rejoiced in
them as representatives of the great gift-making race, and indulged
himself in a dream of pipe-smoking, orations, treaties, presents
and alliances, finding its climax in the marriage of his virgin
queen to the king of France, and unvaryingly tending to the swiftly
increasing aggrandizement of Listening Crane. They sat down to
bear's meat, sagamite and beans. The queen sat down with them,
clothed in her entire wardrobe: vest of swan's skin, with facings
of purple and green from the neck of the mallard; petticoat of
plaited hair, with embroideries of quills; leggings of fawn-skin;
garters of wampum; black and green serpent-skin moccasins, that
rested on pelts of tiger-cat and buffalo; armlets of gars' scales,
necklaces of bears' claws and alligators' teeth, plaited tresses,
plumes of raven and flamingo, wing of the pink curlew, and odors of
bay and sassafras. Young men danced before them, blowing upon
reeds, hooting, yelling, rattling beans in gourds and touching
hands and feet. One day was like another, and the nights were made
brilliant with flambeau dances and processions.</p>
<p>Some days later M. D'Iberville's canoe fleet, returning down the
river, found and took from the shore the two men, whom they had
given up for dead, and with them, by her own request, the
abdicating queen, who left behind her a crowd of weeping and
howling squaws and warriors. Three canoes that put off in their
wake, at a word from her, turned back; but one old man leaped into
the water, swam after them a little way, and then unexpectedly
sank. It was that cautious wader but inexperienced swimmer, the
Listening Crane.</p>
<p>When the expedition reached Biloxi, there were two suitors for
the hand of Agricola's great ancestress. Neither of them was Zephyr
Grandissime. (Ah! the strong heads of those Grandissimes.)</p>
<p>They threw dice for her. Demosthenes De Grapion--he who,
tradition says, first hoisted the flag of France over the little
fort--seemed to think he ought to have a chance, and being accorded
it, cast an astonishingly high number; but Epaminondas cast a
number higher by one (which Demosthenes never could quite
understand), and got a wife who had loved him from first sight.</p>
<p>Thus, while the pilgrim fathers of the Mississippi Delta with
Gallic recklessness were taking wives and moot-wives from the ill
specimens of three races, arose, with the church's benediction, the
royal house of the Fusiliers in Louisiana. But the true, main
Grandissime stock, on which the Fusiliers did early, ever, and yet
do, love to marry, has kept itself lily-white ever since France has
loved lilies--as to marriage, that is; as to less responsible
entanglements, why, of course--</p>
<p>After a little, the disappointed Demosthenes, with due
ecclesiastical sanction, also took a most excellent wife, from the
first cargo of House of Correction girls. Her biography, too, is as
short as Methuselah's, or shorter; she died. Zephyr Grandissime
married, still later, a lady of rank, a widow without children,
sent from France to Biloxi under a <i>lettre de cachet</i>.
Demosthenes De Grapion, himself an only son, left but one son, who
also left but one. Yet they were prone to early marriages.</p>
<p>So also were the Grandissimes, or, as the name is signed in all
the old notarial papers, the Brahmin Mandarin de Grandissimes. That
was one thing that kept their many-stranded family line so free
from knots and kinks. Once the leisurely Zephyr gave them a start,
generation followed generation with a rapidity that kept the
competing De Grapions incessantly exasperated, and new-made
Grandissime fathers continually throwing themselves into the fond
arms and upon the proud necks of congratulatory grandsires. Verily
it seemed as though their family tree was a fig-tree; you could not
look for blossoms on it, but there, instead, was the fruit full of
seed. And with all their speed they were for the most part fine of
stature, strong of limb and fair of face. The old nobility of their
stock, including particularly the unnamed blood of her of the
<i>lettre de cachet</i>, showed forth in a gracefulness of
carriage, that almost identified a De Grandissime wherever you saw
him, and in a transparency of flesh and classic beauty of feature,
that made their daughters extra-marriageable in a land and day
which was bearing a wide reproach for a male celibacy not of the
pious sort.</p>
<p>In a flock of Grandissimes might always be seen a Fusilier or
two; fierce-eyed, strong-beaked, dark, heavy-taloned birds, who, if
they could not sing, were of rich plumage, and could talk, and
bite, and strike, and keep up a ruffled crest and a self-exalting
bad humor. They early learned one favorite cry, with which they
greeted all strangers, crying the louder the more the endeavor was
made to appease them: "Invaders! Invaders!"</p>
<p>There was a real pathos in the contrast offered to this family
line by that other which sprang up, as slenderly as a stalk of wild
oats, from the loins of Demosthenes De Grapion. A lone son
following a lone son, and he another--it was sad to contemplate, in
that colonial beginning of days, three generations of good, Gallic
blood tripping jocundly along in attenuated Indian file. It made it
no less pathetic to see that they were brilliant, gallant,
much-loved, early epauletted fellows, who did not let twenty-one
catch them without wives sealed with the authentic wedding kiss,
nor allow twenty-two to find them without an heir. But they had a
sad aptness for dying young. It was altogether supposable that they
would have spread out broadly in the land; but they were such
inveterate duelists, such brave Indian-fighters, such adventurous
swamp-rangers, and such lively free-livers, that, however
numerously their half-kin may have been scattered about in an
unacknowledged way, the avowed name of De Grapion had become less
and less frequent in lists where leading citizens subscribed their
signatures, and was not to be seen in the list of managers of the
late ball.</p>
<p>It is not at all certain that so hot a blood would not have
boiled away entirely before the night of the <i>bal
masqu&eacute;</i>, but for an event which led to the union of that
blood with a stream equally clear and ruddy, but of a milder
vintage. This event fell out some fifty-two years after that cast
of the dice which made the princess Lufki-Humma the mother of all
the Fusiliers and of none of the De Grapions. Clotilde, the
Casket-Girl, the little maid who would not marry, was one of an
heroic sort, worth--the De Grapions maintained--whole swampfuls of
Indian queens. And yet the portrait of this great ancestress, which
served as a pattern to one who, at the ball, personated the
long-deceased heroine <i>en masque</i>, is hopelessly lost in some
garret. Those Creoles have such a shocking way of filing their
family relics and records in rat-holes.</p>
<p>One fact alone remains to be stated: that the De Grapions, try
to spurn it as they would, never could quite suppress a hard
feeling in the face of the record, that from the two young men,
who, when lost in the horrors of Louisiana's swamps, had been
esteemed as good as dead, and particularly from him who married at
his leisure,--from Zephyr de Grandissime,--sprang there so many as
the sands of the Mississippi innumerable.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A MAIDEN WHO WILL NOT MARRY</h3>
<br>
<p>Midway between the times of Lufki-Humma and those of her proud
descendant, Agricola Fusilier, fifty-two years lying on either
side, were the days of Pierre Rigaut, the magnificent, the "Grand
Marquis," the Governor, De Vaudreuil. He was the Solomon of
Louisiana. For splendor, however, not for wisdom. Those were the
gala days of license, extravagance and pomp. He made paper money to
be as the leaves of the forest for multitude; it was nothing
accounted of in the days of the Grand Marquis. For Louis Quinze was
king.</p>
<p>Clotilde, orphan of a murdered Huguenot, was one of sixty, the
last royal allotment to Louisiana, of imported wives. The king's
agents had inveigled her away from France with fair stories: "They
will give you a quiet home with some lady of the colony. Have to
marry?--not unless it pleases you. The king himself pays your
passage and gives you a casket of clothes. Think of that these
times, fillette; and passage free, withal, to--the garden of Eden,
as you may call it--what more, say you, can a poor girl want?
Without doubt, too, like a model colonist, you will accept a good
husband and have a great many beautiful children, who will say with
pride, 'Me, I am no House-of-Correction-girl stock; my mother'--or
'grandmother,' as the case may be--'was a <i>fille &agrave; la
cassette!</i>'"</p>
<p>The sixty were landed in New Orleans and given into the care of
the Ursuline nuns; and, before many days had elapsed, fifty-nine
soldiers of the king were well wived and ready to settle upon their
riparian land-grants. The residuum in the nuns' hands was one
stiff-necked little heretic, named, in part, Clotilde. They bore
with her for sixty days, and then complained to the Grand Marquis.
But the Grand Marquis, with all his pomp, was gracious and
kind-hearted, and loved his ease almost as much as his marchioness
loved money. He bade them try her another month. They did so, and
then returned with her; she would neither marry nor pray to
Mary.</p>
<p>Here is the way they talked in New Orleans in those days. If you
care to understand why Louisiana has grown up so out of joint, note
the tone of those who governed her in the middle of the last
century:</p>
<p>"What, my child," the Grand Marquis said, "you a <i>fille
&agrave; la cassette?</i> France, for shame! Come here by my side.
Will you take a little advice from an old soldier? It is in one
word--submit. Whatever is inevitable, submit to it. If you want to
live easy and sleep easy, do as other people do--submit. Consider
submission in the present case; how easy, how comfortable, and how
little it amounts to! A little hearing of mass, a little telling of
beads, a little crossing of one's self--what is that? One need not
believe in them. Don't shake your head. Take my example; look at
me; all these things go in at this ear and out at this. Do king or
clergy trouble me? Not at all. For how does the king in these
matters of religion? I shall not even tell you, he is such a bad
boy. Do you not know that all the <i>noblesse</i>, and all the
<i>savants</i>, and especially all the archbishops and
cardinals,--all, in a word, but such silly little chicks as
yourself,--have found out that this religious business is a joke?
Actually a joke, every whit; except, to be sure, this heresy phase;
that is a joke they cannot take. Now, I wish you well, pretty
child; so if you--eh?--truly, my pet, I fear we shall have to call
you unreasonable. Stop; they can spare me here a moment; I will
take you to the Marquise: she is in the next room.... Behold," said
he, as he entered the presence of his marchioness, "the little maid
who will not marry!"</p>
<p>The Marquise was as cold and hard-hearted as the Marquis was
loose and kind; but we need not recount the slow tortures of the
<i>fille &agrave; la cassette's</i> second verbal temptation. The
colony had to have soldiers, she was given to understand, and the
soldiers must have wives. "Why, I am a soldier's wife, myself!"
said the gorgeously attired lady, laying her hand upon the
governor-general's epaulet. She explained, further, that he was
rather softhearted, while she was a business woman; also that the
royal commissary's rolls did not comprehend such a thing as a
spinster, and--incidentally--that living by principle was rather
out of fashion in the province just then.</p>
<p>After she had offered much torment of this sort, a definite
notion seemed to take her; she turned her lord by a touch of the
elbow, and exchanged two or three business-like whispers with him
at a window overlooking the Levee.</p>
<p>"Fillette," she said, returning, "you are going to live on the
sea-coast. I am sending an aged lady there to gather the wax of the
wild myrtle. This good soldier of mine buys it for our king at
twelve livres the pound. Do you not know that women can make money?
The place is not safe; but there are no safe places in Louisiana.
There are no nuns to trouble you there; only a few Indians and
soldiers. You and Madame will live together, quite to yourselves,
and can pray as you like."</p>
<p>"And not marry a soldier," said the Grand Marquis.</p>
<p>"No," said the lady, "not if you can gather enough
myrtle-berries to afford me a profit and you a living."</p>
<p>It was some thirty leagues or more eastward to the country of
the Biloxis, a beautiful land of low, evergreen hills looking out
across the pine-covered sand-keys of Mississippi Sound to the Gulf
of Mexico. The northern shore of Biloxi Bay was rich in
candleberry-myrtle. In Clotilde's day, though Biloxi was no longer
the capital of the Mississippi Valley, the fort which D'Iberville
had built in 1699, and the first timber of which is said to have
been lifted by Zephyr Grandissime at one end and Epaminondas
Fusilier at the other, was still there, making brave against the
possible advent of corsairs, with a few old culverines and one
wooden mortar.</p>
<p>And did the orphan, in despite of Indians and soldiers and
wilderness, settle down here and make a moderate fortune? Alas, she
never gathered a berry! When she--with the aged lady, her appointed
companion in exile, the young commandant of the fort, in whose
pinnace they had come, and two or three French sailors and
Canadians--stepped out upon the white sand of Biloxi beach, she was
bound with invisible fetters hand and foot, by that Olympian rogue
of a boy, who likes no better prey than a little maiden who thinks
she will never marry.</p>
<p>The officer's name was De Grapion--Georges De Grapion. The
Marquis gave him a choice grant of land on that part of the
Mississippi river "coast" known as the Cannes Brul&eacute;es.</p>
<p>"Of course you know where Cannes Brul&eacute;es is, don't you?"
asked Doctor Keene of Joseph Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Joseph, with a twinge of reminiscence that recalled
the study of Louisiana on paper with his father and sisters.</p>
<p>There Georges De Grapion settled, with the laudable
determination to make a fresh start against the mortifyingly
numerous Grandissimes.</p>
<p>"My father's policy was every way bad," he said to his spouse;
"it is useless, and probably wrong, this trying to thin them out by
duels; we will try another plan. Thank you," he added, as she
handed his coat back to him, with the shoulder-straps cut off. In
pursuance of the new plan, Madame De Grapion,--the precious little
heroine!--before the myrtles offered another crop of berries, bore
him a boy not much smaller (saith tradition) than herself.</p>
<p>Only one thing qualified the father's elation. On that very day
Numa Grandissime (Brahmin-Mandarin de Grandissime), a mere child,
received from Governor de Vaudreuil a cadetship.</p>
<p>"Never mind, Messieurs Grandissime, go on with your tricks; we
shall see! Ha! we shall see!"</p>
<p>"We shall see what?" asked a remote relative of that family.
"Will Monsieur be so good as to explain himself?"</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Bang! bang!</p>
<p>Alas, Madame De Grapion!</p>
<p>It may be recorded that no affair of honor in Louisiana ever
left a braver little widow. When Joseph and his doctor pretended to
play chess together, but little more than a half-century had
elapsed since the <i>fille &agrave; la cassette</i> stood before
the Grand Marquis and refused to wed. Yet she had been long gone
into the skies, leaving a worthy example behind her in twenty years
of beautiful widowhood. Her son, the heir and resident of the
plantation at Cannes Brul&eacute;es, at the age of--they do
say--eighteen, had married a blithe and pretty lady of
Franco-Spanish extraction, and, after a fair length of life divided
between campaigning under the brilliant young Galvez and raising
unremunerative indigo crops, had lately lain down to sleep, leaving
only two descendants--females--how shall we describe them?--a Monk
and a <i>Fille &agrave; la Cassette</i>. It was very hard to have
to go leaving his family name snuffed out and certain
Grandissime-ward grievances burning.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>"There are so many Grandissimes," said the weary-eyed
Frowenfeld, "I cannot distinguish between--I can scarcely count
them."</p>
<p>"Well, now," said the doctor, "let me tell you, don't try. They
can't do it themselves. Take them in the mass--as you would
shrimps."</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>LOST OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
<br>
<p>The little doctor tipped his chair back against the wall, drew
up his knees, and laughed whimperingly in his freckled hands.</p>
<p>"I had to do some prodigious lying at that ball. I didn't dare
let the De Grapion ladies know they were in company with a
Grandissime."</p>
<p>"I thought you said their name was Nancanou."</p>
<p>"Well, certainly--De Grapion-Nancanou. You see, that is one of
their charms: one is a widow, the other is her daughter, and both
as young and beautiful as Hebe. Ask Honor&eacute; Grandissime; he
has seen the little widow; but then he don't know who she is. He
will not ask me, and I will not tell him. Oh, yes; it is about
eighteen years now since old De Grapion--elegant, high-stepping old
fellow--married her, then only sixteen years of age, to young
Nancanou, an indigo-planter on the Fausse Rivi&egrave;re--the old
bend, you know, behind Pointe Coup&eacute;e. The young couple went
there to live. I have been told they had one of the prettiest
places in Louisiana. He was a man of cultivated tastes, educated in
Paris, spoke English, was handsome (convivial, of course), and of
perfectly pure blood. But there was one thing old De Grapion
overlooked: he and his son-in-law were the last of their names. In
Louisiana a man needs kinsfolk. He ought to have married his
daughter into a strong house. They say that Numa Grandissime
(Honor&eacute;'s father) and he had patched up a peace between the
two families that included even old Agricola, and that he could
have married her to a Grandissime. However, he is supposed to have
known what he was about.</p>
<p>"A matter of business called young Nancanou to New Orleans. He
had no friends here; he was a Creole, but what part of his life had
not been spent on his plantation he had passed in Europe. He could
not leave his young girl of a wife alone in that exiled sort of
plantation life, so he brought her and the child (a girl) down with
him as far as to her father's place, left them there, and came on
to the city alone.</p>
<p>"Now, what does the old man do but give him a letter of
introduction to old Agricole Fusilier! (His name is Agricola, but
we shorten it to Agricole.) It seems that old De Grapion and
Agricole had had the indiscretion to scrape up a mutually
complimentary correspondence. And to Agricole the young man
went.</p>
<p>"They became intimate at once, drank together, danced with the
quadroons together, and got into as much mischief in three days as
I ever did in a fortnight. So affairs went on until by and by they
were gambling together. One night they were at the Piety Club,
playing hard, and the planter lost his last quarti. He became
desperate, and did a thing I have known more than one planter to
do: wrote his pledge for every arpent of his land and every slave
on it, and staked that. Agricole refused to play. 'You shall play,'
said Nancanou, and when the game was ended he said: 'Monsieur
Agricola Fusilier, you cheated.' You see? Just as I have frequently
been tempted to remark to my friend, Mr. Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"But, Frowenfeld, you must know, withal the Creoles are such
gamblers, they never cheat; they play absolutely fair. So Agricole
had to challenge the planter. He could not be blamed for that;
there was no choice--oh, now, Frowenfeld, keep quiet! I tell you
there was no choice. And the fellow was no coward. He sent Agricole
a clear title to the real estate and slaves,--lacking only the
wife's signature,--accepted the challenge and fell dead at the
first fire.</p>
<p>"Stop, now, and let me finish. Agricole sat down and wrote to
the widow that he did not wish to deprive her of her home, and that
if she would state in writing her belief that the stakes had been
won fairly, he would give back the whole estate, slaves and all;
but that if she would not, he should feel compelled to retain it in
vindication of his honor. Now wasn't that drawing a fine point?"
The doctor laughed according to his habit, with his face down in
his hands. "You see, he wanted to stand before all creation--the
Creator did not make so much difference--in the most exquisitely
proper light; so he puts the laws of humanity under his feet, and
anoints himself from head to foot with Creole punctilio."</p>
<p>"Did she sign the paper?" asked Joseph.</p>
<p>"She? Wait till you know her! No, indeed; she had the true
scorn. She and her father sent down another and a better title.
Creole-like, they managed to bestir themselves to that extent and
there they stopped.</p>
<p>"And the airs with which they did it! They kept all their rage
to themselves, and sent the polite word, that they were not
acquainted with the merits of the case, that they were not disposed
to make the long and arduous trip to the city and back, and that if
M. Fusilier de Grandissime thought he could find any pleasure or
profit in owning the place, he was welcome; that the widow of
<i>his late friend</i> was not disposed to live on it, but would
remain with her father at the paternal home at Cannes
Brul&eacute;es.</p>
<p>"Did you ever hear of a more perfect specimen of Creole pride?
That is the way with all of them. Show me any Creole, or any number
of Creoles, in any sort of contest, and right down at the
foundation of it all, I will find you this same preposterous,
apathetic, fantastic, suicidal pride. It is as lethargic and
ferocious as an alligator. That is why the Creole almost always is
(or thinks he is) on the defensive. See these De Grapions' haughty
good manners to old Agricole; yet there wasn't a Grandissime in
Louisiana who could have set foot on the De Grapion lands but at
the risk of his life.</p>
<p>"But I will finish the story: and here is the really sad part.
Not many months ago old De Grapion--'old,' said I; they don't grow
old; I call him old--a few months ago he died. He must have left
everything smothered in debt; for, like his race, he had stuck to
indigo because his father planted it, and it is a crop that has
lost money steadily for years and years. His daughter and
granddaughter were left like babes in the wood; and, to crown their
disasters, have now made the grave mistake of coming to the city,
where they find they haven't a friend--not one, sir! They called me
in to prescribe for a trivial indisposition, shortly after their
arrival; and I tell you, Frowenfeld, it made me shiver to see two
such beautiful women in such a town as this without a male
protector, and even"--the doctor lowered his voice--"without
adequate support. The mother says they are perfectly comfortable;
tells the old couple so who took them to the ball, and whose little
girl is their embroidery scholar; but you cannot believe a Creole
on that subject, and I don't believe her. Would you like to make
their acquaintance?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld hesitated, disliking to say no to his friend, and
then shook his head.</p>
<p>"After a while--at least not now, sir, if you please."</p>
<p>The doctor made a gesture of disappointment.</p>
<p>"Um-hum," he said grumly--"the only man in New Orleans I would
honor with an invitation!--but all right; I'll go alone."</p>
<p>He laughed a little at himself, and left Frowenfeld, if ever he
should desire it, to make the acquaintance of his pretty neighbors
as best he could.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>WAS IT HONOR&Eacute; GRANDISSIME?</h3>
<br>
<p>A Creole gentleman, on horseback one morning with some practical
object in view,--drainage, possibly,--had got what he sought,--the
evidence of his own eyes on certain points,--and now moved quietly
across some old fields toward the town, where more absorbing
interests awaited him in the Rue Toulouse; for this Creole
gentleman was a merchant, and because he would presently find
himself among the appointments and restraints of the counting-room,
he heartily gave himself up, for the moment, to the surrounding
influences of nature.</p>
<p>It was late in November; but the air was mild and the grass and
foliage green and dewy. Wild flowers bloomed plentifully and in all
directions; the bushes were hung, and often covered, with vines of
sprightly green, sprinkled thickly with smart-looking little
worthless berries, whose sparkling complacency the combined
contempt of man, beast and bird could not dim. The call of the
field-lark came continually out of the grass, where now and then
could be seen his yellow breast; the orchard oriole was executing
his fantasias in every tree; a covey of partridges ran across the
path close under the horse's feet, and stopped to look back almost
within reach of the riding-whip; clouds of starlings, in their odd,
irresolute way, rose from the high bulrushes and settled again,
without discernible cause; little wandering companies of sparrows
undulated from hedge to hedge; a great rabbit-hawk sat alone in the
top of a lofty pecan-tree; that petted rowdy, the mocking-bird,
dropped down into the path to offer fight to the horse, and,
failing in that, flew up again and drove a crow into ignominious
retirement beyond the plain; from a place of flags and reeds a
white crane shot upward, turned, and then, with the slow and
stately beat peculiar to her wing, sped away until, against the
tallest cypress of the distant forest, she became a tiny white
speck on its black, and suddenly disappeared, like one flake of
snow.</p>
<p>The scene was altogether such as to fill any hearty soul with
impulses of genial friendliness and gentle candor; such a scene as
will sometimes prepare a man of the world, upon the least direct
incentive, to throw open the windows of his private thought with a
freedom which the atmosphere of no counting-room or drawing-room
tends to induce.</p>
<p>The young merchant--he was young--felt this. Moreover, the
matter of business which had brought him out had responded to his
inquiring eye with a somewhat golden radiance; and your true man of
business--he who has reached that elevated pitch of serene,
good-natured reserve which is of the high art of his calling--is
never so generous with his pennyworths of thought as when newly in
possession of some little secret worth many pounds.</p>
<p>By and by the behavior of the horse indicated the near presence
of a stranger; and the next moment the rider drew rein under an
immense live-oak where there was a bit of paling about some graves,
and raised his hat.</p>
<p>"Good-morning, sir." But for the silent r's, his pronunciation
was exact, yet evidently an acquired one. While he spoke his
salutation in English, he was thinking in French: "Without doubt,
this rather oversized, bareheaded, interrupted-looking convalescent
who stands before me, wondering how I should know in what language
to address him, is Joseph Frowenfeld, of whom Doctor Keene has had
so much to say to me. A good face--unsophisticated, but
intelligent, mettlesome and honest. He will make his mark; it will
probably be a white one; I will subscribe to the adventure.</p>
<p>"You will excuse me, sir?" he asked after a pause, dismounting,
and noticing, as he did so, that Frowenfeld's knees showed recent
contact with the turf; "I have, myself, some interest in two of
these graves, sir, as I suppose--you will pardon my freedom--you
have in the other four."</p>
<p>He approached the old but newly whitened paling, which encircled
the tree's trunk as well as the six graves about it. There was in
his face and manner a sort of impersonal human kindness, well
calculated to engage a diffident and sensitive stranger, standing
in dread of gratuitous benevolence or pity.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said the convalescent, and ceased; but the other
leaned against the palings in an attitude of attention, and he felt
induced to add: "I have buried here my father, mother, and two
sisters,"--he had expected to continue in an unemotional tone; but
a deep respiration usurped the place of speech. He stooped quickly
to pick up his hat, and, as he rose again and looked into his
listener's face, the respectful, unobtrusive sympathy there
expressed went directly to his heart.</p>
<p>"Victims of the fever," said the Creole with great gravity. "How
did that happen?"</p>
<p>As Frowenfeld, after a moment's hesitation, began to speak, the
stranger let go the bridle of his horse and sat down upon the turf.
Joseph appreciated the courtesy and sat down, too; and thus the ice
was broken.</p>
<p>The immigrant told his story; he was young--often younger than
his years--and his listener several years his senior; but the
Creole, true to his blood, was able at any time to make himself as
young as need be, and possessed the rare magic of drawing one's
confidence without seeming to do more than merely pay attention. It
followed that the story was told in full detail, including grateful
acknowledgment of the goodness of an unknown friend, who had
granted this burial-place on condition that he should not be sought
out for the purpose of thanking him.</p>
<p>So a considerable time passed by, in which acquaintance grew
with delightful rapidity.</p>
<p>"What will you do now?" asked the stranger, when a short silence
had followed the conclusion of the story.</p>
<p>"I hardly know. I am taken somewhat by surprise. I have not
chosen a definite course in life--as yet. I have been a general
student, but have not prepared myself for any profession; I am not
sure what I shall be."</p>
<p>A certain energy in the immigrant's face half redeemed this
childlike speech. Yet the Creole's lips, as he opened them to
reply, betrayed amusement; so he hastened to say:</p>
<p>"I appreciate your position, Mr. Frowenfeld,--excuse me, I
believe you said that was your father's name. And yet,"--the shadow
of an amused smile lurked another instant about a corner of his
mouth,--"if you would understand me kindly I would say, take
care--"</p>
<p>What little blood the convalescent had rushed violently to his
face, and the Creole added:</p>
<p>"I do not insinuate you would willingly be idle. I think I know
what you want. You want to make up your mind <i>now</i> what you
will <i>do</i>, and at your leisure what you will <i>be</i>; eh? To
be, it seems to me," he said in summing up,--"that to be is not so
necessary as to do, eh? or am I wrong?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," replied Joseph, still red, "I was feeling that just
now. I will do the first thing that offers; I can dig."</p>
<p>The Creole shrugged and pouted.</p>
<p>"And be called a <i>dos brile</i>--a 'burnt-back.'"</p>
<p>"But"--began the immigrant, with overmuch warmth.</p>
<p>The other interrupted him, shaking his head slowly and smiling
as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld, it is of no use to talk; you may hold in
contempt the Creole scorn of toil--just as I do, myself, but in
theory, my-de'-seh, not too much in practice. You cannot afford to
be <i>entirely</i> different from the community in which you live;
is that not so?"</p>
<p>"A friend of mine," said Frowenfeld, "has told me I must
'compromise.'"</p>
<p>"You must get acclimated," responded the Creole; "not in body
only, that you have done; but in mind--in taste--in
conversation--and in convictions too, yes, ha, ha! They all do
it--all who come. They hold out a little while--a very little; then
they open their stores on Sunday, they import cargoes of Africans,
they bribe the officials, they smuggle goods, they have colored
housekeepers. My-de'-seh, the water must expect to take the shape
of the bucket; eh?"</p>
<p>"One need not be water!" said the immigrant.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the Creole, with another amiable shrug, and a wave of
his hand; "certainly you do not suppose that is my advice--that
those things have my approval."</p>
<p>Must we repeat already that Frowenfeld was abnormally young?
"Why have they not your condemnation?" cried he with an earnestness
that made the Creole's horse drop the grass from his teeth and
wheel half around.</p>
<p>The answer came slowly and gently.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld, my habit is to buy cheap and sell at a profit.
My condemnation? My-de'-seh, there is no sa-a-ale for it! it spoils
the sale of other goods my-de'-seh. It is not to condemn that you
want; you want to suc-<i>ceed</i>. Ha, ha, ha! you see I am a
merchant, eh? My-de'-seh, can <i>you</i> afford not to
succeed?"</p>
<p>The speaker had grown very much in earnest in the course of
these few words, and as he asked the closing question, arose,
arranged his horse's bridle and, with his elbow in the saddle,
leaned his handsome head on his equally beautiful hand. His whole
appearance was a dazzling contradiction of the notion that a Creole
is a person of mixed blood.</p>
<p>"I think I can!" replied the convalescent, with much spirit,
rising with more haste than was good, and staggering a moment.</p>
<p>The horseman laughed outright.</p>
<p>"Your principle is the best, I cannot dispute that; but whether
you can act it out--reformers do not make money, you know." He
examined his saddle-girth and began to tighten it. "One can
condemn--too cautiously--by a kind of--elevated cowardice (I have
that fault); but one can also condemn too rashly; I remember when I
did so. One of the occupants of those two graves you see yonder
side by side--I think might have lived longer if I had not spoken
so rashly for his rights. Did you ever hear of Bras-Coup&eacute;,
Mr. Frowenfeld?"</p>
<p>"I have heard only the name."</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Frowenfeld, <i>there</i> was a bold man's chance to
denounce wrong and oppression! Why, that negro's death changed the
whole channel of my convictions."</p>
<p>The speaker had turned and thrown up his arm with frowning
earnestness; he dropped it and smiled at himself.</p>
<p>"Do not mistake me for one of your new-fashioned Philadelphia
'<i>negrophiles</i>'; I am a merchant, my-de'-seh, a good subject
of His Catholic Majesty, a Creole of the Creoles, and so forth, and
so forth. Come!"</p>
<p>He slapped the saddle.</p>
<p>To have seen and heard them a little later as they moved toward
the city, the Creole walking before the horse, and Frowenfeld
sitting in the saddle, you might have supposed them old
acquaintances. Yet the immigrant was wondering who his companion
might be. He had not introduced himself--seemed to think that even
an immigrant might know his name without asking. Was it
Honor&eacute; Grandissime? Joseph was tempted to guess so; but the
initials inscribed on the silver-mounted pommel of the fine old
Spanish saddle did not bear out that conjecture.</p>
<p>The stranger talked freely. The sun's rays seemed to set all the
sweetness in him a-working, and his pleasant worldly wisdom foamed
up and out like fermenting honey.</p>
<p>By and by the way led through a broad, grassy lane where the
path turned alternately to right and left among some wild acacias.
The Creole waved his hand toward one of them and said:</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. Frowenfeld, you see? one man walks where he sees
another's track; that is what makes a path; but you want a man,
instead of passing around this prickly bush, to lay hold of it with
his naked hands and pull it up by the roots."</p>
<p>"But a man armed with the truth is far from being barehanded,"
replied the convalescent, and they went on, more and more
interested at every step,--one in this very raw imported material
for an excellent man, the other in so striking an exponent of a
unique land and people.</p>
<p>They came at length to the crossing of two streets, and the
Creole, pausing in his speech, laid his hand upon the bridle.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld dismounted.</p>
<p>"Do we part here?" asked the Creole. "Well, Mr. Frowenfeld, I
hope to meet you soon again."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I thank you, sir," said Joseph, "and I hope we shall,
although--"</p>
<p>The Creole paused with a foot in the stirrup and interrupted him
with a playful gesture; then as the horse stirred, he mounted and
drew in the rein.</p>
<p>"I know; you want to say you cannot accept my philosophy and I
cannot appreciate yours; but I appreciate it more than you think,
my-de'-seh."</p>
<p>The convalescent's smile showed much fatigue.</p>
<p>The Creole extended his hand; the immigrant seized it, wished to
ask his name, but did not; and the next moment he was gone.</p>
<p>The convalescent walked meditatively toward his quarters, with a
faint feeling of having been found asleep on duty and awakened by a
passing stranger. It was an unpleasant feeling, and he caught
himself more than once shaking his head. He stopped, at length, and
looked back; but the Creole was long since out of sight. The
mortified self-accuser little knew how very similar a feeling that
vanished person was carrying away with him. He turned and resumed
his walk, wondering who Monsieur might be, and a little impatient
with himself that he had not asked.</p>
<p>"It is Honor&eacute; Grandissime; it must be he!" he said.</p>
<p>Yet see how soon he felt obliged to change his mind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>SIGNED--HONOR&Eacute; GRANDISSIME</h3>
<br>
<p>On the afternoon of the same day, having decided what he would
"do," he started out in search of new quarters. He found nothing
then, but next morning came upon a small, single-story building in
the rue Royale,--corner of Conti,--which he thought would suit his
plans. There were a door and show-window in the rue Royale, two
doors in the intersecting street, and a small apartment in the rear
which would answer for sleeping, eating, and studying purposes, and
which connected with the front apartment by a door in the left-hand
corner. This connection he would partially conceal by a
prescription-desk. A counter would run lengthwise toward the rue
Royale, along the wall opposite the side-doors. Such was the spot
that soon became known as "Frowenfeld's Corner."</p>
<p>The notice "&Agrave; Louer" directed him to inquire at
numero--rue Cond&eacute;. Here he was ushered through the wicket of
a <i>porte coch&egrave;re</i> into a broad, paved corridor, and up
a stair into a large, cool room, and into the presence of a man who
seemed, in some respects, the most remarkable figure he had yet
seen in this little city of strange people. A strong, clear, olive
complexion; features that were faultless (unless a woman-like
delicacy, that was yet not effeminate, was a fault); hair <i>en
queue</i>, the handsomer for its premature streakings of gray; a
tall, well knit form, attired in cloth, linen and leather of the
utmost fineness; manners Castilian, with a gravity almost
oriental,--made him one of those rare masculine figures which, on
the public promenade, men look back at and ladies inquire
about.</p>
<p>Now, who might <i>this</i> be? The rent poster had given no
name. Even the incurious Frowenfeld would fain guess a little. For
a man to be just of this sort, it seemed plain that he must live in
an isolated ease upon the unceasing droppings of coupons, rents,
and like receivables. Such was the immigrant's first conjecture;
and, as with slow, scant questions and answers they made their
bargain, every new glance strengthened it; he was evidently a
<i>rentier</i>. What, then, was his astonishment when Monsieur bent
down and made himself Frowenfeld's landlord, by writing what the
universal mind esteemed the synonym of enterprise and activity--the
name of Honor&eacute; Grandissime. The landlord did not see, or
ignored, his tenant's glance of surprise, and the tenant asked no
questions.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>We may add here an incident which seemed, when it took place, as
unimportant as a single fact well could be.</p>
<p>The little sum that Frowenfeld had inherited from his father had
been sadly depleted by the expenses of four funerals; yet he was
still able to pay a month's rent in advance, to supply his shop
with a scant stock of drugs, to purchase a celestial globe and some
scientific apparatus, and to buy a dinner or two of sausages and
crackers; but after this there was no necessity of hiding his
purse.</p>
<p>His landlord early contracted a fondness for dropping in upon
him, and conversing with him, as best the few and labored English
phrases at his command would allow. Frowenfeld soon noticed that he
never entered the shop unless its proprietor was alone, never sat
down, and always, with the same perfection of dignity that
characterized all his movements, departed immediately upon the
arrival of any third person. One day, when the landlord was making
one of these standing calls,--he always stood' beside a high glass
case, on the side of the shop opposite the counter,--he noticed in
Joseph's hand a sprig of basil, and spoke of it.</p>
<p>"You ligue?"</p>
<p>The tenant did not understand. "You--find--dad--nize?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld replied that it had been left by the oversight of a
customer, and expressed a liking for its odor.</p>
<p>"I sand you," said the landlord,--a speech whose meaning
Frowenfeld was not sure of until the next morning, when a small,
nearly naked black boy, who could not speak a word of English,
brought to the apothecary a luxuriant bunch of this basil, growing
in a rough box.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>ILLUSTRATING THE TRACTIVE POWER OF BASIL</h3>
<br>
<p>On the twenty-fourth day of December, 1803, at two o'clock,
P.M., the thermometer standing at 79, hygrometer 17, barometer
29.880, sky partly clouded, wind west, light, the apothecary of the
rue Royale, now something more than a month established in his
calling, might have been seen standing behind his counter and
beginning to show embarrassment in the presence of a lady, who,
since she had got her prescription filled and had paid for it,
ought in the conventional course of things to have hurried out,
followed by the pathetically ugly black woman who tarried at the
door as her attendant; for to be in an apothecary's shop at all was
unconventional. She was heavily veiled; but the sparkle of her
eyes, which no multiplication of veils could quite extinguish, her
symmetrical and well-fitted figure, just escaping smallness, her
grace of movement, and a soft, joyous voice, had several days
before led Frowenfeld to the confident conclusion that she was
young and beautiful.</p>
<p>For this was now the third time she had come to buy; and, though
the purchases were unaccountably trivial, the purchaser seemed not
so. On the two previous occasions she had been accompanied by a
slender girl, somewhat taller than she, veiled also, of graver
movement, a bearing that seemed to Joseph almost too regal, and a
discernible unwillingness to enter or tarry. There seemed a certain
family resemblance between her voice and that of the other, which
proclaimed them--he incautiously assumed--sisters. This time, as we
see, the smaller, and probably elder, came alone.</p>
<p>She still held in her hand the small silver which Frowenfeld had
given her in change, and sighed after the laugh they had just
enjoyed together over a slip in her English. A very grateful sip of
sweet the laugh was to the all but friendless apothecary, and the
embarrassment that rushed in after it may have arisen in part from
a conscious casting about in his mind for something--anything--that
might prolong her stay an instant. He opened his lips to speak; but
she was quicker than he, and said, in a stealthy way that seemed
oddly unnecessary:</p>
<p>"You 'ave some basilic?"</p>
<p>She accompanied her words with a little peeping movement,
directing his attention, through the open door, to his box of
basil, on the floor in the rear room.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld stepped back to it, cut half the bunch and returned,
with the bold intention of making her a present of it; but as he
hastened back to the spot he had left, he was astonished to see the
lady disappearing from his farthest front door, followed by her
negress.</p>
<p>"Did she change her mind, or did she misunderstand me?" he asked
himself; and, in the hope that she might return for the basil, he
put it in water in his back room.</p>
<p>The day being, as the figures have already shown, an unusually
mild one, even for a Louisiana December, and the finger of the
clock drawing by and by toward the last hour of sunlight, some half
dozen of Frowenfeld's townsmen had gathered, inside and out, some
standing, some sitting, about his front door, and all discussing
the popular topics of the day. For it might have been anticipated
that, in a city where so very little English was spoken and no
newspaper published except that beneficiary of eighty subscribers,
the "Moniteur de la Louisiane," the apothecary's shop in the rue
Royale would be the rendezvous for a select company of
English-speaking gentlemen, with a smart majority of
physicians.</p>
<p>The Cession had become an accomplished fact. With due
drum-beatings and act-reading, flag-raising, cannonading and
galloping of aides-de-camp, Nouvelle Orl&eacute;ans had become New
Orleans, and Louisiane was Louisiana. This afternoon, the first
week of American jurisdiction was only something over half gone,
and the main topic of public debate was still the Cession. Was it
genuine? and, if so, would it stand?</p>
<p>"Mark my words," said one, "the British flag will be floating
over this town within ninety days!" and he went on whittling the
back of his chair.</p>
<p>From this main question, the conversation branched out to the
subject of land titles. Would that great majority of Spanish
titles, derived from the concessions of post-commandants and others
of minor authority, hold good?</p>
<p>"I suppose you know what ---- thinks about it?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, he has quietly purchased the grant made by Carondelet to
the Marquis of----, thirty thousand acres, and now says the grant
is two hundred <i>and</i> thirty thousand. That is one style of men
Governor Claiborne is going to have on his hands. The town will
presently be as full of them as my pocket is of tobacco
crumbs,--every one of them with a Spanish grant as long as Clark's
ropewalk and made up since the rumor of the Cession."</p>
<p>"I hear that some of Honor&eacute; Grandissime's titles are
likely to turn out bad,--some of the old Brahmin properties and
some of the Mandarin lands."</p>
<p>"Fudge!" said Dr. Keene.</p>
<p>There was also the subject of rotation in office. Would this
provisional governor-general himself be able to stand fast? Had not
a man better temporize a while, and see what Ex-Governor-general
Casa Calvo and Trudeau were going to do? Would not men who
sacrificed old prejudices, braved the popular contumely, and came
forward and gave in their allegiance to the President's appointee,
have to take the chances of losing their official positions at
last? Men like Camille Brahmin, for instance, or Charlie Mandarin:
suppose Spain or France should get the province back, then where
would they be?</p>
<p>"One of the things I pity most in this vain world," drawled
Doctor Keene, "is a hive of patriots who don't know where to
swarm."</p>
<p>The apothecary was drawn into the discussion--at least he
thought he was. Inexperience is apt to think that Truth will be
knocked down and murdered unless she comes to the rescue. Somehow,
Frowenfeld's really excellent arguments seemed to give out more
heat than light. They were merciless; their principles were not
only lofty to dizziness, but precipitous, and their heights
unoccupied, and--to the common sight--unattainable. In consequence,
they provoked hostility and even resentment. With the kindest, the
most honest, and even the most modest, intentions, he found
himself--to his bewilderment and surprise--sniffed at by the
ungenerous, frowned upon by the impatient, and smiled down by the
good-natured in a manner that brought sudden blushes of
exasperation to his face, and often made him ashamed to find
himself going over these sham battles again in much savageness of
spirit, when alone with his books; or, in moments of weakness,
casting about for such unworthy weapons as irony and satire. In the
present debate, he had just provoked a sneer that made his blood
leap and his friends laugh, when Doctor Keene, suddenly rising and
beckoning across the street, exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Oh! Agricole! Agricole! <i>venez ici</i>; we want you."</p>
<p>A murmur of vexed protest arose from two or three.</p>
<p>"He's coming," said the whittler, who had also beckoned.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Citizen Fusilier," said Doctor Keene. "Citizen
Fusilier, allow me to present my friend, Professor Frowenfeld--yes,
you are a professor--yes, you are. He is one of your sort, Citizen
Fusilier, a man of thorough scientific education. I believe on my
soul, sir, he knows nearly as much as you do!"</p>
<p>The person who confronted the apothecary was a large, heavily
built, but well-molded and vigorous man, of whom one might say that
he was adorned with old age. His brow was dark, and furrowed partly
by time and partly by a persistent, ostentatious frown. His eyes
were large, black and bold, and the gray locks above them curled
short and harsh like the front of a bull. His nose was fine and
strong, and if there was any deficiency in mouth or chin, it was
hidden by a beard that swept down over his broad breast like the
beard of a prophet. In his dress, which was noticeably soiled, the
fashions of three decades were hinted at; he seemed to have donned
whatever he thought his friends would most have liked him to leave
off.</p>
<p>"Professor," said the old man, extending something like the paw
of a lion, and giving Frowenfeld plenty of time to become
thoroughly awed, "this is a pleasure as magnificent as unexpected!
A scientific man?--in Louisiana?" He looked around upon the doctors
as upon a graduating class.</p>
<p>"Professor, I am rejoiced!" He paused again, shaking the
apothecary's hand with great ceremony. "I do assure you, sir, I
dislike to relinquish your grasp. Do me the honor to allow me to
become your friend! I congratulate my downtrodden country on the
acquisition of such a citizen! I hope, sir,--at least I might have
hoped, had not Louisiana just passed into the hands of the most
clap-trap government in the universe, notwithstanding it pretends
to be a republic,--I might have hoped that you had come among us to
fasten the lie direct upon a late author, who writes of us that
'the air of this region is deadly to the Muses.'"</p>
<p>"He didn't say that?" asked one of the debaters, with pretended
indignation.</p>
<p>"He did, sir, after eating our bread!"</p>
<p>"And sucking our sugar-cane, too, no doubt!" said the wag; but
the old man took no notice.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld, naturally, was not anxious to reply, and was greatly
relieved to be touched on the elbow by a child with a picayune in
one hand and a tumbler in the other. He escaped behind the counter
and gladly remained there.</p>
<p>"Citizen Fusilier," asked one of the gossips, "what has the new
government to do with the health of the Muses?"</p>
<p>"It introduces the English tongue," said the old man,
scowling.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," replied the questioner, "the Creoles will soon learn
the language."</p>
<p>"English is not a language, sir; it is a jargon! And when this
young simpleton, Claiborne, attempts to cram it down the public
windpipe in the courts, as I understand he intends, he will fail!
Hah! sir, I know men in this city who would rather eat a dog than
speak English! I speak it, but I also speak Choctaw."</p>
<p>"The new land titles will be in English."</p>
<p>"They will spurn his rotten titles. And if he attempts to
invalidate their old ones, why, let him do it! Napoleon Buonaparte"
(Italian pronounciation) "will make good every arpent within the
next two years. <i>Think so?</i> I know it! <i>How?</i> H-I
perceive it! H-I hope the yellow fever may spare you to witness
it."</p>
<p>A sullen grunt from the circle showed the "citizen" that he had
presumed too much upon the license commonly accorded his advanced
age, and by way of a diversion he looked around for Frowenfeld to
pour new flatteries upon. But Joseph, behind his counter, unaware
of either the offense or the resentment, was blushing with pleasure
before a visitor who had entered by the side door farthest from the
company.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," said Agricola, "h-my dear friends, you must not
expect an old Creole to like anything in comparison with <i>la
belle langue</i>."</p>
<p>"Which language do you call <i>la belle?</i>" asked Doctor
Keene, with pretended simplicity.</p>
<p>The old man bent upon him a look of unspeakable contempt, which
nobody noticed. The gossips were one by one stealing a glance
toward that which ever was, is and must be an irresistible
lodestone to the eyes of all the sons of Adam, to wit, a chaste and
graceful complement of--skirts. Then in a lower tone they resumed
their desultory conversation.</p>
<p>It was the seeker after basil who stood before the counter,
holding in her hand, with her purse, the heavy veil whose folds had
before concealed her features.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>"OO DAD IS, 'SIEUR FROWENFEL'?"</h3>
<br>
<p>Whether the removal of the veil was because of the milder light
of the evening, or the result of accident, or of haste, or both, or
whether, by reason of some exciting or absorbing course of thought,
the wearer had withdrawn it unconsciously, was a matter that
occupied the apothecary as little as did Agricola's continued
harangue. As he looked upon the fair face through the light gauze
which still overhung but not obscured it, he readily perceived,
despite the sprightly smile, something like distress, and as she
spoke this became still more evident in her hurried undertone.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', I want you to sell me doze
<i>basilic</i>."</p>
<p>As she slipped the rings of her purse apart her fingers
trembled.</p>
<p>"It is waiting for you," said Frowenfeld; but the lady did not
hear him; she was giving her attention to the loud voice of
Agricola saying in the course of discussion:</p>
<p>"The Louisiana Creole is the noblest variety of enlightened
man!"</p>
<p>"Oo dad is, 'Sieur Frowenfel'?" she asked, softly, but with an
excited eye.</p>
<p>"That is Mr. Agricola Fusilier," answered Joseph in the same
tone, his heart leaping inexplicably as he met her glance. With an
angry flush she looked quickly around, scrutinized the old man in
an instantaneous, thorough way, and then glanced back at the
apothecary again, as if asking him to fulfil her request the
quicker.</p>
<p>He hesitated, in doubt as to her meaning.</p>
<p>"Wrap it yonder," she almost whispered.</p>
<p>He went, and in a moment returned, with the basil only partially
hid in a paper covering.</p>
<p>But the lady, muffled again in her manifold veil, had once more
lost her eagerness for it; at least, instead of taking it, she
moved aside, offering room for a masculine figure just entering.
She did not look to see who it might be--plenty of time to do that
by accident, by and by. There she made a mistake; for the
new-comer, with a silent bow of thanks, declined the place made for
him, moved across the shop, and occupied his eyes with the contents
of the glass case, his back being turned to the lady and
Frowenfeld. The apothecary recognized the Creole whom he had met
under the live-oak.</p>
<p>The lady put forth her hand suddenly to receive the package. As
she took it and turned to depart, another small hand was laid upon
it and it was returned to the counter. Something was said in a
low-pitched undertone, and the two sisters--if Frowenfeld's guess
was right--confronted each other. For a single instant only they
stood so; an earnest and hurried murmur of French words passed
between them, and they turned together, bowed with great suavity,
and were gone.</p>
<p>"The Cession is a mere temporary political manoeuvre!" growled
M. Fusilier.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's merchant friend came from his place of waiting, and
spoke twice before he attracted the attention of the bewildered
apothecary.</p>
<p>"Good-day, Mr. Frowenfeld; I have been told that--"</p>
<p>Joseph gazed after the two ladies crossing the street, and felt
uncomfortable that the group of gossips did the same. So did the
black attendant who glanced furtively back.</p>
<p>"Good-day, Mr. Frowenfeld; I--"</p>
<p>"Oh! how do you do, sir?" exclaimed the apothecary, with great
pleasantness, of face. It seemed the most natural thing that they
should resume their late conversation just where they had left off,
and that would certainly be pleasant. But the man of more
experience showed an unresponsive expression, that was as if he
remembered no conversation of any note.</p>
<p>"I have been told that you might be able to replace the glass in
this thing out of your private stock."</p>
<p>He presented a small, leather-covered case, evidently containing
some optical instrument. "It will give me a pretext for going," he
had said to himself, as he put it into his pocket in his
counting-room. He was not going to let the apothecary know he had
taken such a fancy to him.</p>
<p>"I do not know," replied Frowenfeld, as he touched the spring of
the case; "I will see what I have."</p>
<p>He passed into the back room, more than willing to get out of
sight till he might better collect himself.</p>
<p>"I do not keep these things for sale," said he as he went.</p>
<p>"Sir?" asked the Creole, as if he had not understood, and
followed through the open door.</p>
<p>"Is this what that lady was getting?" he asked, touching the
remnant of the basil in the box.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said the apothecary, with his face in the drawer of
a table.</p>
<p>"They had no carriage with them." The Creole spoke with his back
turned, at the same time running his eyes along a shelf of books.
Frowenfeld made only the sound of rejecting bits of crystal and
taking up others. "I do not know who they are," ventured the
merchant.</p>
<p>Joseph still gave no answer, but a moment after approached, with
the instrument in his extended hand.</p>
<p>"You had it? I am glad," said the owner, receiving it, but
keeping one hand still on the books.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld put up his materials.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld, are these your books? I mean do you use these
books?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>The Creole stepped back to the door.</p>
<p>"Agricola!"</p>
<p>"<i>Quoi</i>!"</p>
<p>"<i>Vien ici</i>."</p>
<p>Citizen Fusilier entered, followed by a small volley of retorts
from those with whom he had been disputing, and who rose as he did.
The stranger said something very sprightly in French, running the
back of one finger down the rank of books, and a lively dialogue
followed.</p>
<p>"You must be a great scholar," said the unknown by and by,
addressing the apothecary.</p>
<p>"He is a professor of chimistry," said the old man.</p>
<p>"I am nothing, as yet, but a student," said Joseph, as the three
returned into the shop; "certainly not a scholar, and still less a
professor." He spoke with a new quietness of manner that made the
younger Creole turn upon him a pleasant look.</p>
<p>"H-my young friend," said the patriarch, turning toward Joseph
with a tremendous frown, "when I, Agricola Fusilier, pronounce you
a professor, you are a professor. Louisiana will not look to
<i>you</i> for your credentials; she will look to me!"</p>
<p>He stumbled upon some slight impediment under foot. There were
times when it took but little to make Agricola stumble.</p>
<p>Looking to see what it was, Joseph picked up a silken purse.
There was a name embroidered on it.</p>

<h3>SUDDEN FLASHES OF LIGHT</h3>
<br>
<p>The day was nearly gone. The company that had been chatting at
the front door, and which in warmer weather would have tarried
until bedtime, had wandered off; however, by stepping toward the
light the young merchant could decipher the letters on the purse.
Citizen Fusilier drew out a pair of spectacles, looked over his
junior's shoulder, read aloud, "<i>Aurore De G. Nanca</i>--," and
uttered an imprecation.</p>
<p>"Do not speak to me!" he thundered; "do not approach me! she did
it maliciously!"</p>
<p>"Sir!" began Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>But the old man uttered another tremendous malediction and
hurried into the street and away.</p>
<p>"Let him pass," said the other Creole calmly.</p>
<p>"What is the matter with him?" asked Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"He is getting old." The Creole extended the purse carelessly to
the apothecary. "Has it anything inside?"</p>
<p>"But a single pistareen."</p>
<p>"That is why she wanted the <i>basilic</i>, eh?"</p>
<p>"I do not understand you, sir."</p>
<p>"Do you not know what she was going to do with it?"</p>
<p>"With the basil? No sir."</p>
<p>"May be she was going to make a little tisane, eh?" said the
Creole, forcing down a smile.</p>
<p>But a portion of the smile would come when Frowenfeld answered,
with unnecessary resentment:</p>
<p>"She was going to make some proper use of it, which need not
concern me."</p>
<p>"Without doubt."</p>
<p>The Creole quietly walked a step or two forward and back and
looked idly into the glass case. "Is this young man in love with
her?" he asked himself. He turned around.</p>
<p>"Do you know those ladies, Mr. Frowenfeld? Do you visit them at
home?"</p>
<p>He drew out his porte-monnaie.</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"I will pay you for the repair of this instrument; have you
change for--"</p>
<p>"I will see," said the apothecary.</p>
<p>As he spoke he laid the purse on a stool, till he should light
his shop, and then went to his till without again taking it.</p>
<p>The Creole sauntered across to the counter and nipped the herb
which still lay there.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld, you know what some very excellent people do
with this? They rub it on the sill of the door to make the money
come into the house."</p>
<p>Joseph stopped aghast with the drawer half drawn.</p>
<p>"Not persons of intelligence and--"</p>
<p>"All kinds. It is only some of the foolishness which they take
from the slaves. Many of your best people consult the voudou
horses."</p>
<p>"Horses?"</p>
<p>"Priestesses, you might call them," explained the Creole, "like
Momselle Marcelline or 'Zabeth Philosophe."</p>
<p>"Witches!" whispered Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"Oh no," said the other with a shrug; "that is too hard a name;
say fortune-tellers. But Mr. Frowenfeld, I wish you to lend me your
good offices. Just supposing the possi<i>bil</i>ity that that lady
may be in need of money, you know, and will send back or come back
for the purse, you know, knowing that she most likely lost it here,
I ask you the favor that you will not let her know I have filled it
with gold. In fact, if she mentions my name--"</p>
<p>"To confess the truth, sir, I am not acquainted with your
name."</p>
<p>The Creole smiled a genuine surprise.</p>
<p>"I thought you knew it." He laughed a little at himself. "We
have nevertheless become very good friends--I believe? Well, in
fact then, Mr. Frowenfeld, you might say you do not know who put
the money in." He extended his open palm with the purse hanging
across it. Joseph was about to object to this statement, but the
Creole, putting on an expression of anxious desire, said: "I mean,
not by name. It is somewhat important to me, Mr. Frowenfeld, that
that lady should not know my present action. If you want to do
those two ladies a favor, you may rest assured the way to do it is
to say you do not know who put this gold." The Creole in his
earnestness slipped in his idiom. "You will excuse me if I do not
tell you my name; you can find it out at any time from Agricola.
Ah! I am glad she did not see me! You must not tell anybody about
this little event, eh?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," said Joseph, as he finally accepted the purse. "I
shall say nothing to any one else, and only what I cannot avoid
saying to the lady and her sister."</p>
<p>"<i>'Tis not her sister</i>" responded the Creole, "<i>'tis her
daughter</i>."</p>
<p>The italics signify, not how the words were said, but how they
sounded to Joseph. As if a dark lantern were suddenly turned full
upon it, he saw the significance of Citizen Fusilier's transport.
The fair strangers were the widow and daughter of the man whom
Agricola had killed in duel--the ladies with whom Doctor Keene had
desired to make him acquainted.</p>
<p>"Well, good evening, Mr. Frowenfeld." The Creole extended his
hand (his people are great hand-shakers). "Ah--" and then, for the
first time, he came to the true object of his visit. "The
conversation we had some weeks ago, Mr. Frowenfeld, has started a
train of thought in my mind"--he began to smile as if to convey the
idea that Joseph would find the subject a trivial one--"which has
almost brought me to the--"</p>
<p>A light footfall accompanied with the soft sweep of robes cut
short his words. There had been two or three entrances and exits
during the time the Creole had tarried, but he had not allowed them
to disturb him. Now, however, he had no sooner turned and fixed his
glance upon this last comer, than without so much as the invariable
Creole leave-taking of "Well, good evening, sir," he hurried
out.</p>

<h3>THE PHILOSOPHE</h3>
<br>
<p>The apothecary felt an inward nervous start as there advanced
into the light of his hanging lamp and toward the spot where he had
halted, just outside the counter, a woman of the quadroon caste, of
superb stature and poise, severely handsome features, clear, tawny
skin and large, passionate black eyes.</p>
<p>"<i>Bon soi', Mich&eacute;</i>." [Monsieur.] A rather hard, yet
not repellent smile showed her faultless teeth.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld bowed.</p>
<p>"<i>Mo vien c'erc'er la bourse de Madame</i>."</p>
<p>She spoke the best French at her command, but it was not
understood.</p>
<p>The apothecary could only shake his head.</p>
<p>"<i>La bourse</i>" she repeated, softly smiling, but with a
scintillation of the eyes in resentment of his scrutiny. "<i>La
bourse</i>" she reiterated.</p>
<p>"Purse?"</p>
<p>"<i>Oui, Mich&eacute;</i>."</p>
<p>"You are sent for it?"</p>
<p>"<i>Oui, Mich&eacute;</i>."</p>
<p>He drew it from his breast pocket and marked the sudden glisten
of her eyes, reflecting the glisten of the gold in the silken
mesh.</p>
<p>"<i>Oui, c'est &ccedil;a</i>," said she, putting her hand out
eagerly.</p>
<p>"I am afraid to give you this to-night," said Joseph.</p>
<p>"<i>Oui</i>," ventured she, dubiously, the lightning playing
deep back in her eyes.</p>
<p>"You might be robbed," said Frowenfeld. "It is very dangerous
for you to be out alone. It will not be long, now, until gun-fire."
(Eight o'clock P.M.--the gun to warn slaves to be in-doors, under
pain of arrest and imprisonment.)</p>
<p>The object of this solicitude shook her head with a smile at its
gratuitousness. The smile showed determination also.</p>
<p>"<i>Mo pas compren</i>'," she said.</p>
<p>"Tell the lady to send for it to-morrow."</p>
<p>She smiled helplessly and somewhat vexedly, shrugged and again
shook her head. As she did so she heard footsteps and voices in the
door at her back.</p>
<p>"<i>C'est &ccedil;a</i>" she said again with a hurried attempt
at extreme amiability; "Dat it; <i>oui</i>;" and lifting her hand
with some rapidity made a sudden eager reach for the purse, but
failed.</p>
<p>"No!" said Frowenfeld, indignantly.</p>
<p>"Hello!" said Charlie Keene amusedly, as he approached from the
door.</p>
<p>The woman turned, and in one or two rapid sentences in the
Creole dialect offered her explanation.</p>
<p>"Give her the purse, Joe; I will answer for its being all
right."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld handed it to her. She started to pass through the
door in the rue Royale by which Doctor Keene had entered; but on
seeing on its threshold Agricola frowning upon her, she turned
quickly with evident trepidation, and hurried out into the darkness
of the other street.</p>
<p>Agricola entered. Doctor Keene looked about the shop.</p>
<p>"I tell you, Agricole, you didn't have it with you; Frowenfeld,
you haven't seen a big knotted walking-stick?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld was sure no walking-stick had been left there.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, Frowenfeld," said Doctor Keene, with a little laugh,
as the three sat down, "I'd a'most as soon trust that woman as if
she was white."</p>
<p>The apothecary said nothing.</p>
<p>"How free," said Agricola, beginning with a meditative gaze at
the sky without, and ending with a philosopher's smile upon his two
companions,--"how free we people are from prejudice against the
negro!"</p>
<p>"The white people," said Frowenfeld, half abstractedly, half
inquiringly.</p>
<p>"H-my young friend, when we say, 'we people,' we <i>always</i>
mean we white people. The non-mention of color always implies pure
white; and whatever is not pure white is to all intents and
purposes pure black. When I say the 'whole community,' I mean the
whole white portion; when I speak of the 'undivided public
sentiment,' I mean the sentiment of the white population. What else
could I mean? Could you suppose, sir, the expression which you may
have heard me use--'my downtrodden country'--includes blacks and
mulattoes? What is that up yonder in the sky? The moon. The new
moon, or the old moon, or the moon in her third quarter, but always
the moon! Which part of it? Why, the shining part--the white part,
always and only! Not that there is a prejudice against the negro.
By no means. Wherever he can be of any service in a strictly menial
capacity we kindly and generously tolerate his presence."</p>
<p>Was the immigrant growing wise, or weak, that he remained
silent?</p>
<p>Agricola rose as he concluded and said he would go home. Doctor
Keene gave him his hand lazily, without rising.</p>
<p>"Frowenfeld," he said, with a smile and in an undertone, as
Agricola's footsteps died away, "don't you know who that woman
is?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll tell you."</p>
<p>He told him.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>On that lonely plantation at the Cannes Brul&eacute;es, where
Aurore Nancanou's childhood had been passed without brothers or
sisters, there had been given her, according to the well-known
custom of plantation life, a little quadroon slave-maid as her
constant and only playmate. This maid began early to show herself
in many ways remarkable. While yet a child she grew tall, lithe,
agile; her eyes were large and black, and rolled and sparkled if
she but turned to answer to her name. Her pale yellow forehead, low
and shapely, with the jet hair above it, the heavily pencilled
eyebrows and long lashes below, the faint red tinge that blushed
with a kind of cold passion through the clear yellow skin of the
cheek, the fulness of the red, voluptuous lips and the roundness of
her perfect neck, gave her, even at fourteen, a barbaric and
magnetic beauty, that startled the beholder like an unexpected
drawing out of a jewelled sword. Such a type could have sprung only
from high Latin ancestry on the one side and--we might
venture--Jaloff African on the other. To these charms of person she
added mental acuteness, conversational adroitness, concealed
cunning, and noiseless but visible strength of will; and to these,
that rarest of gifts in one of her tincture, the purity of true
womanhood.</p>
<p>At fourteen a necessity which had been parleyed with for two
years or more became imperative, and Aurore's maid was taken from
her. Explanation is almost superfluous. Aurore was to become a lady
and her playmate a lady's maid; but not <i>her</i> maid, because
the maid had become, of the two, the ruling spirit. It was a
question of grave debate in the mind of M. De Grapion what
disposition to make of her.</p>
<p>About this time the Grandissimes and De Grapions, through
certain efforts of Honor&eacute;'s father (since dead) were making
some feeble pretences of mutual good feeling, and one of those
Kentuckian dealers in corn and tobacco whose flatboat fleets were
always drifting down the Mississippi, becoming one day M. De
Grapion's transient guest, accidentally mentioned a wish of
Agricola Fusilier. Agricola, it appeared, had commissioned him to
buy the most beautiful lady's maid that in his extended journeyings
he might be able to find; he wanted to make her a gift to his
niece, Honor&eacute;'s sister. The Kentuckian saw the demand met in
Aurore's playmate. M. De Grapion would not sell her. (Trade with a
Grandissime? Let them suspect he needed money?) No; but he would
ask Agricola to accept the services of the waiting-maid for, say,
ten years. The Kentuckian accepted the proposition on the spot and
it was by and by carried out. She was never recalled to the Cannes
Brul&eacute;es, but in subsequent years received her freedom from
her master, and in New Orleans became Palmyre la Philosophe, as
they say in the corrupt French of the old Creoles, or Palmyre
Philosophe, noted for her taste and skill as a hair-dresser, for
the efficiency of her spells and the sagacity of her divinations,
but most of all for the chaste austerity with which she practised
the less baleful rites of the voudous.</p>
<p>"That's the woman," said Doctor Keene, rising to go, as he
concluded the narrative,--"that's she, Palmyre Philosophe. Now you
get a view of the vastness of Agricole's generosity; he tolerates
her even though she does not present herself in the 'strictly
menial capacity.' Reason why--<i>he's afraid of her</i>."</p>
<p>Time passed, if that may be called time which we have to measure
with a clock. The apothecary of the rue Royale found better ways of
measurement. As quietly as a spider he was spinning information
into knowledge and knowledge into what is supposed to be wisdom;
whether it was or not we shall see. His unidentified merchant
friend who had adjured him to become acclimated as "they all did"
had also exhorted him to study the human mass of which he had
become a unit; but whether that study, if pursued, was sweetening
and ripening, or whether it was corrupting him, that friend did not
come to see; it was the busy time of year. Certainly so young a
solitary, coming among a people whose conventionalities were so at
variance with his own door-yard ethics, was in sad danger of being
unduly--as we might say--Timonized. His acquaintances continued to
be few in number.</p>
<p>During this fermenting period he chronicled much wet and some
cold weather. This may in part account for the uneventfulness of
its passage; events do not happen rapidly among the Creoles in bad
weather. However, trade was good.</p>
<p>But the weather cleared; and when it was getting well on into
the Creole spring and approaching the spring of the almanacs,
something did occur that extended Frowenfeld's acquaintance without
Doctor Keene's assistance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A CALL FROM THE RENT-SPECTRE</h3>
<br>
<p>It is nearly noon of a balmy morning late in February. Aurore
Nancanou and her daughter have only this moment ceased sewing, in
the small front room of No. 19 rue Bienville. Number 19 is the
right-hand half of a single-story, low-roofed tenement, washed with
yellow ochre, which it shares generously with whoever leans against
it. It sits as fast on the ground as a toad. There is a kitchen
belonging to it somewhere among the weeds in the back yard, and
besides this room where the ladies are, there is, directly behind
it, a sleeping apartment. Somewhere back of this there is a little
nook where in pleasant weather they eat. Their cook and housemaid
is the plain person who attends them on the street. Her bedchamber
is the kitchen and her bed the floor. The house's only other
protector is a hound, the aim of whose life is to get thrust out of
the ladies' apartments every fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Yet if you hastily picture to yourself a forlorn-looking
establishment, you will be moving straight away from the fact.
Neatness, order, excellence, are prevalent qualities in all the
details of the main house's inward garniture. The furniture is
old-fashioned, rich, French, imported. The carpets, if not new, are
not cheap, either. Bits of crystal and silver, visible here and
there, are as bright as they are antiquated; and one or two
portraits, and the picture of Our Lady of Many Sorrows, are
passably good productions. The brass work, of which there is much,
is brilliantly burnished, and the front room is bright and
cheery.</p>
<p>At the street door of this room somebody has just knocked.
Aurore has risen from her seat. The other still sits on a low chair
with her hands and sewing dropped into her lap, looking up
steadfastly into her mother's face with a mingled expression of
fondness and dismayed expectation. Aurore hesitates beside her
chair, desirous of resuming her seat, even lifts her sewing from
it; but tarries a moment, her alert suspense showing in her eyes.
Her daughter still looks up into them. It is not strange that the
dwellers round about dispute as to which is the fairer, nor that in
the six months during which the two have occupied Number 19 the
neighbors have reached no conclusion on this subject. If some young
enthusiast compares the daughter--in her eighteenth year--to a
bursting blush rosebud full of promise, some older one immediately
retorts that the other--in her thirty-fifth--is the red, red,
full-blown, faultless joy of the garden. If one says the maiden has
the dew of youth,--"But!" cry two or three mothers in a breath,
"that other one, child, will never grow old. With her it will
always be morning. That woman is going to last forever;
ha-a-a-a!--even longer!"</p>
<p>There was one direction in which the widow evidently had the
advantage; you could see from the street or the opposite windows
that she was a wise householder. On the day they moved into Number
19 she had been seen to enter in advance of all her other movables,
carrying into the empty house a new broom, a looking-glass, and a
silver coin. Every morning since, a little watching would have
discovered her at the hour of sunrise sprinkling water from her
side casement, and her opposite neighbors often had occasion to
notice that, sitting at her sewing by the front window, she never
pricked her finger but she quickly ran it up behind her ear, and
then went on with her work. Would anybody but Joseph Frowenfeld
ever have lived in and moved away from the two-story brick next
them on the right and not have known of the existence of such a
marvel?</p>
<p>"Ha!" they said, "she knows how to keep off bad luck, that
Madame yonder. And the younger one seems not to like it. Girls
think themselves so smart these days."</p>
<p>Ah, there was the knock again, right there on the street-door,
as loud as if it had been given with a joint of sugar-cane!</p>
<p>The daughter's hand, which had just resumed the needle, stood
still in mid-course with the white thread half-drawn. Aurore
tiptoed slowly over the carpeted floor. There came a shuffling
sound, and the corner of a folded white paper commenced appearing
and disappearing under the door. She mounted a chair and peeped
through that odd little <i>jalousie</i> which formerly was in
almost all New Orleans street-doors; but the missive had meantime
found its way across the sill, and she saw only the unpicturesque
back of a departing errand-boy. But that was well. She had a pride,
to maintain which--and a poverty, to conceal which--she felt to be
necessary to her self-respect; and this made her of necessity a
trifle unsocial in her own castle. Do you suppose she was going to
put on the face of having been born or married to this degraded
condition of things?</p>
<p>Who knows?--the knock might have been from 'Sieur
Frowenfel'--ha, ha! He might be just silly enough to call so early;
or it might have been from that <i>polisson</i> of a
Grandissime,--which one didn't matter, they were all
detestable,--coming to collect the rent. That was her original
fear; or, worse still, it might have been, had it been softer, the
knock of some possible lady visitor. She had no intention of
admitting any feminine eyes to detect this carefully covered up
indigence. Besides, it was Monday. There is no sense in trifling
with bad luck. The reception of Monday callers is a source of
misfortune never known to fail, save in rare cases when good luck
has already been secured by smearing the front walk or the
banquette with Venetian red.</p>
<p>Before the daughter could dart up and disengage herself from her
work her mother had pounced upon the paper. She was standing and
reading, her rich black lashes curtaining their downcast eyes, her
infant waist and round, close-fitted, childish arms harmonizing
prettily with her mock frown of infantile perplexity, and her long,
limp robe heightening the grace of her posture, when the younger
started from her seat with the air of determining not to be left at
a disadvantage.</p>
<p>But what is that on the dark eyelash? With a sudden additional
energy the daughter dashes the sewing and chair to right and left,
bounds up, and in a moment has Aurore weeping in her embrace and
has snatched the note from her hand.</p>
<p>"<i>Ah! maman! Ah! ma ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re</i>!"</p>
<p>The mother forced a laugh. She was not to be mothered by her
daughter; so she made a dash at Clotilde's uplifted hand to recover
the note, which was unavailing. Immediately there arose in colonial
French the loveliest of contentions, the issue of which was that
the pair sat down side by side, like two sisters over one
love-letter, and undertook to decipher the paper. It read as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>"NEW ORLEANS, 20 Feb're, 1804.<br>
<br>
"MADAME NANCANOU: I muss oblige to ass you for rent of that house
whare you living, it is at number 19 Bienville street whare I do
not received thos rent from you not since tree mons and I demand
you this is mabe thirteen time. And I give to you notice of 19 das
writen in Anglish as the new law requi. That witch the law make
necessare only for 15 das, and when you not pay me those rent in 19
das till the tense of Marh I will rekes you to move out. That witch
make me to be verry sorry. I have the honor to remain, Madam,<br>
<br>
<blockquote>"Your humble servant,<br>
"H. Grandissime.<br>
"<i>per</i> Z.F."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a short French postscript on the opposite page signed
only by M. Z&eacute;non Fran&ccedil;ois, explaining that he, who
had allowed them in the past to address him as their landlord and
by his name, was but the landlord's agent; that the landlord was a
far better-dressed man than he could afford to be; that the writing
opposite was a notice for them to quit the premises they had rented
(not leased), or pay up; that it gave the writer great pain to send
it, although it was but the necessary legal form and he only an
irresponsible drawer of an inadequate salary, with thirteen
children to support; and that he implored them to tear off and burn
up this postscript immediately they had read it.</p>
<p>"Ah, the miserable!" was all the comment made upon it as the two
ladies addressed their energies to the previous English. They had
never suspected him of being M. Grandissime.</p>
<p>Their eyes dragged slowly and ineffectually along the lines to
the signature.</p>
<p>"H. Grandissime! Loog ad 'im!" cried the widow, with a sudden
short laugh, that brought the tears after it like a wind-gust in a
rose-tree. She held the letter out before them as if she was
lifting something alive by the back of the neck, and to intensify
her scorn spoke in the hated tongue prescribed by the new courts.
"Loog ad 'im! dad ridge gen'leman oo give so mudge money to de
'ozpill!"</p>
<p>"Bud, <i>maman</i>," said the daughter, laying her hand
appeasingly upon her mother's knee, "<i>ee</i> do nod know 'ow we
is poor."</p>
<p>"Ah!" retorted Aurore, "<i>par example! Non?</i> Ee thingue we
is ridge, eh? Ligue his oncle, eh? Ee thing so, too, eh?" She cast
upon her daughter the look of burning scorn intended for Agricola
Fusilier. "You wan' to tague the pard of dose Grandissime'?"</p>
<p>The daughter returned a look of agony.</p>
<p>"No," she said, "bud a man wad godd some 'ouses to rend, muz ee
nod boun' to ged 'is rend?"</p>
<p>"Boun' to ged--ah! yez ee muz do 'is possible to ged 'is rend.
Oh! certain<i>lee</i>. Ee is ridge, bud ee need a lill money, bad,
bad. Fo' w'at?" The excited speaker rose to her feet under a sudden
inspiration. "<i>Tenez, Mademoiselle!</i>" She began to make great
show of unfastening her dress.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais, comment?</i>" demanded the suffering daughter.</p>
<p>"Yez!" continued Aurore, keeping up the demonstration, "you wand
'im to 'ave 'is rend so bad! An' I godd honely my cloze; so you juz
tague diz to you' fine gen'lemen, 'Sieur Honor&eacute;
Grandissime."</p>
<p>"Ah-h-h-h!" cried the martyr.</p>
<p>"An' you is righd," persisted the tormentor, still unfastening;
but the daughter's tears gushed forth, and the repentant tease
threw herself upon her knees, drew her child's head into her bosom
and wept afresh.</p>
<p>Half an hour was passed in council; at the end of which they
stood beneath their lofty mantelshelf, each with a foot on a brazen
fire-dog, and no conclusion reached.</p>
<p>"Ah, my child!"--they had come to themselves now and were
speaking in their peculiar French--"if we had here in these hands
but the tenth part of what your papa often played away in one night
without once getting angry! But we have not. Ah! but your father
was a fine fellow; if he could have lived for you to know him! So
accomplished! Ha, ha, ha! I can never avoid laughing, when I
remember him teaching me to speak English; I used to enrage him
so!"</p>
<p>The daughter brought the conversation back to the subject of
discussion. There were nineteen days yet allowed them. God
knows--by the expiration of that time they might be able to pay.
With the two music scholars whom she then had and three more whom
she had some hope to get, she made bold to say they could pay the
rent.</p>
<p>"Ah, Clotilde, my child," exclaimed Aurore, with sudden
brightness, "you don't need a mask and costume to resemble your
great-grandmother, the casket-girl!" Aurore felt sure, on her part,
that with the one embroidery scholar then under her tutelage, and
the three others who had declined to take lessons, they could
easily pay the rent--and how kind it was of Monsieur, the aged
father of that one embroidery scholar, to procure those invitations
to the ball! The dear old man! He said he must see one more ball
before he should die.</p>
<p>Aurore looked so pretty in the reverie into which she fell that
her daughter was content to admire her silently.</p>
<p>"Clotilde," said the mother, presently looking up, "do you
remember the evening you treated me so ill?"</p>
<p>The daughter smiled at the preposterous charge.</p>
<p>"I did not treat you ill."</p>
<p>"Yes, don't you know--the evening you made me lose my
purse?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, I know!" The daughter took her foot from the
andiron; her eyes lighted up aggressively. "For losing your purse
blame yourself. For the way you found it again--which was far
worse--thank Palmyre. If you had not asked her to find it and
shared the gold with her we could have returned with it to 'Sieur
Frowenfel'; but now we are ashamed to let him see us. I do not
doubt he filled the purse."</p>
<p>"He? He never knew it was empty. It was Nobody who filled it.
Palmyre says that Papa L&eacute;bat--"</p>
<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Clotilde at this superstitious mention.</p>
<p>The mother tossed her head and turned her back, swallowing the
unendurable bitterness of being rebuked by her daughter. But the
cloud hung over but a moment.</p>
<p>"Clotilde," she said, a minute after, turning with a look of
sun-bright resolve, "I am going to see him."</p>
<p>"To see whom?" asked the other, looking back from the window,
whither she had gone to recover from a reactionary trembling.</p>
<p>"To whom, my child? Why--"</p>
<p>"You do not expect mercy from Honor&eacute; Grandissime? You
would not ask it?"</p>
<p>"No. There is no mercy in the Grandissime blood; but cannot I
demand justice? Ha! it is justice that I shall demand!"</p>
<p>"And you will really go and see him?"</p>
<p>"You will see, Mademoiselle," replied Aurore, dropping a broom
with which she had begun to sweep up some spilled buttons.</p>
<p>"And I with you?"</p>
<p>"No! To a counting-room? To the presence of the chief of that
detestable race? No!"</p>
<p>"But you don't know where his office is."</p>
<p>"Anybody can tell me."</p>
<p>Preparation began at once. By and by--</p>
<p>"Clotilde."</p>
<p>Clotilde was stooping behind her mother, with a ribbon between
her lips, arranging a flounce.</p>
<p>"M-m-m."</p>
<p>"You must not watch me go out of sight; do you hear? ... But it
<i>is</i> dangerous. I knew of a gentleman who watched his wife go
out of his sight and she never came back!"</p>
<p>"Hold still!" said Clotilde.</p>
<p>"But when my hand itches," retorted Aurore in a high key,
"haven't I got to put it instantly into my pocket if I want the
money to come there? Well, then!"</p>
<p>The daughter proposed to go to the kitchen and tell Alphonsina
to put on her shoes.</p>
<p>"My child," cried Aurore, "you are crazy! Do you want Alphonsina
to be seized for the rent?"</p>
<p>"But you cannot go alone--and on foot!"</p>
<p>"I must go alone; and--can you lend me your carriage? Ah, you
have none? Certainly I must go alone and on foot if I am to say I
cannot pay the rent. It is no indiscretion of mine. If anything
happens to me it is M. Grandissime who is responsible."</p>
<p>Now she is ready for the adventurous errand. She darts to the
mirror. The high-water marks are gone from her eyes. She wheels
half around and looks over her shoulder. The flaring bonnet and
loose ribbons gave her a more girlish look than ever.</p>
<p>"Now which is the older, little old woman?" she chirrups, and
smites her daughter's cheek softly with her palm.</p>
<p>"And you are not afraid to go alone?"</p>
<p>"No; but remember! look at that dog!"</p>
<p>The brute sinks apologetically to the floor. Clotilde opens the
street door, hands Aurore the note, Aurore lays a frantic kiss upon
her lips, pressing it on tight so as to get it again when she comes
back, and--while Clotilde calls the cook to gather up the buttons
and take away the broom, and while the cook, to make one trip of
it, gathers the hound into her bosom and carries broom and dog out
together--Aurore sallies forth, leaving Clotilde to resume her
sewing and await the coming of a guitar scholar.</p>
<p>"It will keep her fully an hour," thought the girl, far from
imagining that Aurore had set about a little private business which
she proposed to herself to accomplish before she even started in
the direction of M. Grandissime's counting-rooms.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>BEFORE SUNSET</h3>
<br>
<p>In old times, most of the sidewalks of New Orleans not in the
heart of town were only a rough, rank turf, lined on the side next
the ditch with the gunwales of broken-up flatboats--ugly, narrow,
slippery objects. As Aurora--it sounds so much pleasanter to
anglicize her name--as Aurora gained a corner where two of these
gunwales met, she stopped and looked back to make sure that
Clotilde was not watching her. That others had noticed her here and
there she did not care; that was something beauty would have to
endure, and it only made her smile to herself.</p>
<p>"Everybody sees I am from the country--walking on the street
without a waiting-maid."</p>
<p>A boy passed, hushing his whistle, and gazing at the lone lady
until his turning neck could twist no farther. She was so dewy
fresh! After he had got across the street he turned to look again.
Where could she have disappeared?</p>
<p>The only object to be seen on the corner from which she had
vanished was a small, yellow-washed house much like the one Aurora
occupied, as it was like hundreds that then characterized and still
characterize the town, only that now they are of brick instead of
adobe. They showed in those days, even more than now, the wide
contrast between their homely exteriors and the often elegant
apartments within. However, in this house the front room was merely
neat. The furniture was of rude, heavy pattern, Creole-made, and
the walls were unadorned; the day of cheap pictures had not come.
The lofty bedstead which filled one corner was spread and hung with
a blue stuff showing through a web of white needlework. The brazen
feet of the chairs were brightly burnished, as were the brass
mountings of the bedstead and the brass globes on the cold
andirons. Curtains of blue and white hung at the single window. The
floor, from habitual scrubbing with the common weed which
politeness has to call <i>Helenium autumnale</i>, was stained a
bright, clean yellow. On it were, here and there in places, white
mats woven of bleached palmetto-leaf. Such were the room's
appointments; there was but one thing more, a singular bit of
fantastic carving,--a small table of dark mahogany supported on the
upward-writhing images of three scaly serpents.</p>
<p>Aurora sat down beside this table. A dwarf Congo woman, as black
as soot, had ushered her in, and, having barred the door, had
disappeared, and now the mistress of the house entered.</p>
<p>February though it was, she was dressed--and looked
comfortable--in white. That barbaric beauty which had begun to bud
twenty years before was now in perfect bloom. The united grace and
pride of her movement was inspiring but--what shall we
say?--feline? It was a femininity without humanity,--something that
made her, with all her superbness, a creature that one would want
to find chained. It was the woman who had received the gold from
Frowenfeld--Palmyre Philosophe.</p>
<p>The moment her eyes fell upon Aurora her whole appearance
changed. A girlish smile lighted up her face, and as Aurora rose up
reflecting it back, they simultaneously clapped hands, laughed and
advanced joyously toward each other, talking rapidly without regard
to each other's words.</p>
<p>"Sit down," said Palmyre, in the plantation French of their
childhood, as they shook hands.</p>
<p>They took chairs and drew up face to face as close as they could
come, then sighed and smiled a moment, and then looked grave and
were silent. For in the nature of things, and notwithstanding the
amusing familiarity common between Creole ladies and the menial
class, the unprotected little widow should have had a very serious
errand to bring her to the voudou's house.</p>
<p>"Palmyre," began the lady, in a sad tone.</p>
<p>"Momselle Aurore."</p>
<p>"I want you to help me." The former mistress not only cast her
hands into her lap, lifted her eyes supplicatingly and dropped them
again, but actually locked her fingers to keep them from
trembling.</p>
<p>"Momselle Aurore--" began Palmyre, solemnly.</p>
<p>"Now, I know what you are going to say--but it is of no use to
say it; do this much for me this one time and then I will let
voudou alone as much as you wish--forever!"</p>
<p>"You have not lost your purse <i>again?</i>"</p>
<p>"Ah! foolishness, no."</p>
<p>Both laughed a little, the philosophe feebly, and Aurora with an
excited tremor.</p>
<p>"Well?" demanded the quadroon, looking grave again.</p>
<p>Aurora did not answer.</p>
<p>"Do you wish me to work a spell for you?"</p>
<p>The widow nodded, with her eyes cast down.</p>
<p>Both sat quite still for some time; then the philosophe gently
drew the landlord's letter from between Aurora's hands.</p>
<p>"What is this?" She could not read in any language.</p>
<p>"I must pay my rent within nineteen days."</p>
<p>"Have you not paid it?"</p>
<p>The delinquent shook her head.</p>
<p>"Where is the gold that came into your purse? All gone?"</p>
<p>"For rice and potatoes," said Aurora, and for the first time she
uttered a genuine laugh, under that condition of mind which Latins
usually substitute for fortitude. Palmyre laughed too, very
properly.</p>
<p>Another silence followed. The lady could not return the
quadroon's searching gaze.</p>
<p>"Momselle Aurore," suddenly said Palmyre, "you want me to work a
spell for something else."</p>
<p>Aurora started, looked up for an instant in a frightened way,
and then dropped her eyes and let her head droop, murmuring:</p>
<p>"No, I do not."</p>
<p>Palmyre fixed a long look upon her former mistress. She saw that
though Aurora might be distressed about the rent, there was
something else,--a deeper feeling,--impelling her upon a course the
very thought of which drove the color from her lips and made her
tremble.</p>
<p>"You are wearing red," said the philosophe.</p>
<p>Aurora's hand went nervously to the red ribbon about her
neck.</p>
<p>"It is an accident; I had nothing else convenient."</p>
<p>"Mich&eacute; Agoussou loves red," persisted Palmyre. (Monsieur
Agoussou is the demon upon whom the voudous call in matters of
love.)</p>
<p>The color that came into Aurora's cheek ought to have suited
Monsieur precisely.</p>
<p>"It is an accident," she feebly insisted.</p>
<p>"Well," presently said Palmyre, with a pretence of abandoning
her impression, "then you want me to work you a spell for money, do
you?"</p>
<p>Aurora nodded, while she still avoided the quadroon's
glance.</p>
<p>"I know better," thought the philosophe. "You shall have the
sort you want."</p>
<p>The widow stole an upward glance.</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Palmyre, with the manner of one making a decided
digression, "I have been wanting to ask you something. That evening
at the pharmacy--was there a tall, handsome gentleman standing by
the counter?"</p>
<p>"He was standing on the other side."</p>
<p>"Did you see his face?"</p>
<p>"No; his back was turned."</p>
<p>"Momselle Aurore," said Palmyre, dropping her elbows upon her
knees and taking the lady's hand as if the better to secure the
truth, "was that the gentleman you met at the ball?"</p>
<p>"My faith!" said Aurora, stretching her eyebrows upward. "I did
not think to look. Who was it?"</p>
<p>But Palmyre Philosophe was not going to give more than she got,
even to her old-time Momselle; she merely straightened back into
her chair with an amiable face.</p>
<p>"Who do you think he is?" persisted Aurora, after a pause,
smiling downward and toying with her rings.</p>
<p>The quadroon shrugged.</p>
<p>They both sat in reverie for a moment--a long moment for such
sprightly natures--and Palmyre's mien took on a professional
gravity. She presently pushed the landlord's letter under the
lady's hands as they lay clasped in her lap, and a moment after
drew Aurora's glance with her large, strong eyes and asked:</p>
<p>"What shall we do?"</p>
<p>The lady immediately looked startled and alarmed and again
dropped her eyes in silence. The quadroon had to speak again.</p>
<p>"We will burn a candle."</p>
<p>Aurora trembled.</p>
<p>"No," she succeeded in saying.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Palmyre, "you must get your rent money." But the
charm which she was meditating had no reference to rent money. "She
knows that," thought the voudou.</p>
<p>As she rose and called her Congo slave-woman, Aurora made as if
to protest further; but utterance failed her. She clenched her
hands and prayed to fate for Clotilde to come and lead her away as
she had done at the apothecary's. And well she might.</p>
<p>The articles brought in by the servant were simply a little
pound-cake and cordial, a tumbler half-filled with the <i>sirop
naturelle</i> of the sugar-cane, and a small piece of candle of the
kind made from the fragrant green wax of the candleberry myrtle.
These were set upon the small table, the bit of candle standing,
lighted, in the tumbler of sirup, the cake on a plate, the cordial
in a wine-glass. This feeble child's play was all; except that as
Palmyre closed out all daylight from the room and received the
offering of silver that "paid the floor" and averted
<i>guillons</i> (interferences of outside imps), Aurora,--alas!
alas!--went down upon her knees with her gaze fixed upon the
candle's flame, and silently called on Assonquer (the imp of good
fortune) to cast his snare in her behalf around the mind and heart
of--she knew not whom.</p>
<p>By and by her lips, which had moved at first, were still and she
only watched the burning wax. When the flame rose clear and long it
was a sign that Assonquer was enlisted in the coveted endeavor.
When the wick sputtered, the devotee trembled in fear of failure.
Its charred end curled down and twisted away from her and her heart
sank; but the tall figure of Palmyre for a moment came between, the
wick was snuffed, the flame tapered up again, and for a long time
burned, a bright, tremulous cone. Again the wick turned down, but
this time toward her,--a propitious omen,--and suddenly fell
through the expended wax and went out in the sirup.</p>
<p>The daylight, as Palmyre let it once more into the apartment,
showed Aurora sadly agitated. In evidence of the innocence of her
fluttering heart, guilt, at least for the moment, lay on it, an
appalling burden.</p>

<b>"Aurora,--alas! alas!--went down upon her knees with her gaze
fixed upon the candle's flame".</b></p>
<br>
<p>"That is all, Palmyre, is it not? I am sure that is all--it must
be all. I cannot stay any longer. I wish I was with Clotilde; I
have stayed too long."</p>
<p>"Yes; all for the present," replied the quadroon. "Here, here is
some charmed basil; hold it between your lips as you walk--"</p>
<p>"But I am going to my landlord's office!"</p>
<p>"Office? Nobody is at his office now; it is too late. You would
find that your landlord had gone to dinner. I will tell you,
though, where you <i>must</i> go. First go home; eat your dinner;
and this evening [the Creoles never say afternoon], about a
half-hour before sunset, walk down Royale to the lower corner of
the Place d'Armes, pass entirely around the square and return up
Royale. Never look behind until you get into your house again."</p>
<p>Aurora blushed with shame.</p>
<p>"Alone?" she exclaimed, quite unnerved and tremulous.</p>
<p>"You will seem to be alone; but I will follow behind you when
you pass here. Nothing shall hurt you. If you do that, the charm
will certainly work; if you do not--"</p>
<p>The quadroon's intentions were good. She was determined to see
who it was that could so infatuate her dear little Momselle; and,
as on such an evening as the present afternoon promised to merge
into all New Orleans promenaded on the Place d'Armes and the levee,
her charm was a very practical one.</p>
<p>"And that will bring the money, will it?" asked Aurora.</p>
<p>"It will bring anything you want."</p>
<p>"Possible?"</p>
<p>"These things that <i>you</i> want, Momselle Aurore, are easy to
bring. You have no charms working against you. But, oh, I wish to
God I could work the <i>curse</i> I want to work!" The woman's eyes
blazed, her bosom heaved, she lifted her clenched hand above her
head and looked upward, crying: "I would give this right hand off
at the wrist to catch Agricola Fusilier where I could work him a
curse! But I shall; I shall some day be revenged!" She pitched her
voice still higher. "I cannot die till I have been! There is
nothing that could kill me, I want my revenge so bad!" As suddenly
as she had broken out, she hushed, unbarred the door, and with a
stern farewell smile saw Aurora turn homeward.</p>
<p>"Give me something to eat, <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>," cried the
exhausted lady, dropping into Clotilde's chair and trying to
die.</p>
<p>"Ah! <i>maman</i>, what makes you look so sick?"</p>
<p>Aurora waved her hand contemptuously and gasped.</p>
<p>"Did you see him? What kept you so long--so long?"</p>
<p>"Ask me nothing; I am so enraged with disappointment. He was
gone to dinner!"</p>
<p>"Ah! my poor mother!"</p>
<p>"And I must go back as soon as I can take a little
<i>sieste</i>. I am determined to see him this very day."</p>
<p>"Ah! my poor mother!"</p>

<h3>ROLLED IN THE DUST</h3>
<br>
<p>"No, Frowenfeld," said little Doctor Keene, speaking for the
after-dinner loungers, "you must take a little human advice. Go,
get the air on the Plaza. We will keep shop for you. Stay as long
as you like and come home in any condition you think best." And
Joseph, tormented into this course, put on his hat and went
out.</p>
<p>"Hard to move as a cow in the moonlight," continued Doctor
Keene, "and knows just about as much of the world. He wasn't aware,
until I told him to-day, that there are two Honor&eacute;
Grandissimes." [Laughter.]</p>
<p>"Why did you tell him?"</p>
<p>"I didn't give him anything but the bare fact. I want to see how
long it will take him to find out the rest."</p>
<p>The Place d'Armes offered amusement to every one else rather
than to the immigrant. The family relation, the most noticeable
feature of its' well-pleased groups, was to him too painful a
reminder of his late losses, and, after an honest endeavor to
flutter out of the inner twilight of himself into the outer glare
of a moving world, he had given up the effort and had passed beyond
the square and seated himself upon a rude bench which encircled the
trunk of a willow on the levee.</p>
<p>The negress, who, resting near by with a tray of cakes before
her, has been for some time contemplating the three-quarter face of
her unconscious neighbor, drops her head at last with a small,
Ethiopian, feminine laugh. It is a self-confession that, pleasant
as the study of his countenance is, to resolve that study into
knowledge is beyond her powers; and very pardonably so it is, she
being but a <i>marchande des g&acirc;teaux</i> (an itinerant
cake-vender), and he, she concludes, a man of parts. There is a
purpose, too, as well as an admission, in the laugh. She would like
to engage him in conversation. But he does not notice. Little
supposing he is the object of even a cake-merchant's attention, he
is lost in idle meditation.</p>
<p>One would guess his age to be as much as twenty-six. His face is
beardless, of course, like almost everybody's around him, and of a
German kind of seriousness. A certain diffidence in his look may
tend to render him unattractive to careless eyes, the more so since
he has a slight appearance of self-neglect. On a second glance, his
refinement shows out more distinctly, and one also sees that he is
not shabby. The little that seems lacking is woman's care, the
brush of attentive fingers here and there, the turning of a fold in
the high-collared coat, and a mere touch on the neckerchief and
shirt-frill. He has a decidedly good forehead. His blue eyes, while
they are both strong and modest, are noticeable, too, as betraying
fatigue, and the shade of gravity in them is deepened by a certain
worn look of excess--in books; a most unusual look in New Orleans
in those days, and pointedly out of keeping with the scene which
was absorbing his attention.</p>
<p>You might mistake the time for mid-May. Before the view lies the
Place d'Armes in its green-breasted uniform of new spring grass
crossed diagonally with white shell walks for facings, and dotted
with the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the city for decorations. Over the
line of shade-trees which marks its farther boundary, the
white-topped twin turrets of St. Louis Cathedral look across it and
beyond the bared site of the removed battery (built by the busy
Carondelet to protect Louisiana from herself and Kentucky, and
razed by his immediate successors) and out upon the Mississippi,
the color of whose surface is beginning to change with the changing
sky of this beautiful and now departing day. A breeze, which is
almost early June, and which has been hovering over the bosom of
the great river and above the turf-covered levee, ceases, as if it
sank exhausted under its burden of spring odors, and in the
profound calm the cathedral bell strikes the sunset hour. From its
neighboring garden, the convent of the Ursulines responds in a tone
of devoutness, while from the parapet of the less pious little Fort
St. Charles, the evening gun sends a solemn ejaculation rumbling
down the "coast;" a drum rolls, the air rises again from the water
like a flock of birds, and many in the square and on the levee's
crown turn and accept its gentle blowing. Rising over the levee
willows, and sinking into the streets,--which are lower than the
water,--it flutters among the balconies and in and out of dim
Spanish arcades, and finally drifts away toward that part of the
sky where the sun is sinking behind the low, unbroken line of
forest. There is such seduction in the evening air, such sweetness
of flowers on its every motion, such lack of cold, or heat, or
dust, or wet, that the people have no heart to stay in-doors; nor
is there any reason why they should. The levee road is dotted with
horsemen, and the willow avenue on the levee's crown, the whole
short mile between Terre aux Boeufs gate on the right and
Tchoupitoulas gate on the left, is bright with promenaders,
although the hour is brief and there will be no twilight; for, so
far from being May, it is merely that same nineteenth of which we
have already spoken,--the nineteenth of Louisiana's delicious
February.</p>
<p>Among the throng were many whose names were going to be written
large in history. There was Casa Calvo,--Sebastian de Casa Calvo de
la Puerta y O'Farril, Marquis of Casa Calvo,--a man then at the
fine age of fifty-three, elegant, fascinating, perfect in Spanish
courtesy and Spanish diplomacy, rolling by in a showy equipage
surrounded by a clanking body-guard of the Catholic king's cavalry.
There was young Daniel Clark, already beginning to amass those
riches which an age of litigation has not to this day consumed; it
was he whom the French colonial prefect, Laussat, in a late letter
to France, had extolled as a man whose "talents for intrigue were
carried to a rare degree of excellence." There was Laussat himself,
in the flower of his years, sour with pride, conscious of great
official insignificance and full of petty spites--he yet tarried in
a land where his beautiful wife was the "model of taste." There was
that convivial old fox, Wilkinson, who had plotted for years with
Miro and did not sell himself and his country to Spain because--as
we now say--"he found he could do better;" who modestly confessed
himself in a traitor's letter to the Spanish king as a man "whose
head may err, but whose heart cannot deceive!" and who brought
Governor Gayoso to an early death-bed by simply out-drinking him.
There also was Edward Livingston, attorney-at-law, inseparably
joined to the mention of the famous Batture cases--though that was
later. There also was that terror of colonial peculators, the old
ex-Intendant Morales, who, having quarrelled with every governor of
Louisiana he ever saw, was now snarling at Casa Calvo from force of
habit.</p>
<p>And the Creoles--the Knickerbockers of Louisiana--but time would
fail us. The Villeres and Destrehans--patriots and patriots' sons;
the De La Chaise family in mourning for young Auguste La Chaise of
Kentuckian-Louisianian-San Domingan history; the Livaudaises,
<i>p&egrave;re et fils</i>, of Haunted House fame, descendants of
the first pilot of the Belize; the pirate brothers Lafitte, moving
among the best; Marigny de Mandeville, afterwards the marquis
member of Congress; the Davezacs, the Mossys, the Boulignys, the
Labatuts, the Bringiers, the De Trudeaus, the De Macartys, the De
la Houssayes, the De Lavilleboeuvres, the Grandpr&eacute;s, the
Forstalls; and the proselyted Creoles: &Eacute;tienne de
Bor&eacute; (he was the father of all such as handle the
sugar-kettle); old man Pitot, who became mayor; Madame Pontalba and
her unsuccessful suitor, John McDonough; the three Girods, the two
Graviers, or the lone Julian Poydras, godfather of orphan girls.
Besides these, and among them as shining fractions of the
community, the numerous representatives of the not only noble, but
noticeable and ubiquitous, family of Grandissime: Grandissimes
simple and Grandissimes compound; Brahmins, Mandarins and
Fusiliers. One, 'Polyte by name, a light, gay fellow, with classic
features, hair turning gray, is standing and conversing with this
group here by the mock-cannon inclosure of the grounds. Another,
his cousin, Charlie Mandarin, a tall, very slender, bronzed
gentleman in a flannel hunting-shirt and buckskin leggings, is
walking, in moccasins, with a sweet lady in whose tasteful attire
feminine scrutiny, but such only, might detect economy, but whose
marked beauty of yesterday is retreating and reappearing in the
flock of children who are noisily running round and round them,
nominally in the care of three fat and venerable black nurses.
Another, yonder, Th&eacute;ophile Grandissime, is whipping his
stockings with his cane, a lithe youngster in the height of the
fashion (be it understood the fashion in New Orleans was five years
or so behind Paris), with a joyous, noble face, a merry tongue and
giddy laugh, and a confession of experiences which these pages,
fortunately for their moral tone, need not recount. All these were
there and many others.</p>
<p>This throng, shifting like the fragments of colored glass in the
kaleidoscope, had its far-away interest to the contemplative
Joseph. To them he was of little interest, or none. Of the many
passers, scarcely an occasional one greeted him, and such only with
an extremely polite and silent dignity which seemed to him like
saying something of this sort: "Most noble alien, give you
good-day--stay where you are. Profoundly yours--"</p>
<p>Two men came through the Place d'Armes on conspicuously fine
horses. One it is not necessary to describe. The other, a man of
perhaps thirty-three or thirty-four years of age, was extremely
handsome and well dressed, the martial fashion of the day showing
his tall and finely knit figure to much advantage. He sat his horse
with an uncommon grace, and, as he rode beside his companion, spoke
and gave ear by turns with an easy dignity sufficient of itself to
have attracted popular observation. It was the apothecary's unknown
friend. Frowenfeld noticed them while they were yet in the middle
of the grounds. He could hardly have failed to do so, for some one
close beside his bench in undoubted allusion to one of the
approaching figures exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Here comes Honor&eacute; Grandissime."</p>
<p>Moreover, at that moment there was a slight unwonted stir on the
Place d'Armes. It began at the farther corner of the square, hard
by the Principal, and spread so quickly through the groups near
about, that in a minute the entire company were quietly made aware
of something going notably wrong in their immediate presence. There
was no running to see it. There seemed to be not so much as any
verbal communication of the matter from mouth to mouth. Rather a
consciousness appeared to catch noiselessly from one to another as
the knowledge of human intrusion comes to groups of deer in a park.
There was the same elevating of the head here and there, the same
rounding of beautiful eyes. Some stared, others slowly approached,
while others turned and moved away; but a common indignation was in
the breast of that thing dreadful everywhere, but terrible in
Louisiana, the Majority. For there, in the presence of those good
citizens, before the eyes of the proudest and fairest mothers and
daughters of New Orleans, glaringly, on the open Plaza, the Creole
whom Joseph had met by the graves in the field, Honor&eacute;
Grandissime, the uttermost flower on the topmost branch of the
tallest family tree ever transplanted from France to Louisiana,
Honor&eacute;,--the worshiped, the magnificent,--in the broad light
of the sun's going down, rode side by side with the Yankee governor
and was not ashamed!</p>
<p>Joseph, on his bench, sat contemplating the two parties to this
scandal as they came toward him. Their horses' flanks were damp
from some pleasant gallop, but their present gait was the soft,
mettlesome movement of animals who will even submit to walk if
their masters insist. As they wheeled out of the broad diagonal
path that crossed the square, and turned toward him in the highway,
he fancied that the Creole observed him. He was not mistaken. As
they seemed about to pass the spot where he sat, M. Grandissime
interrupted the governor with a word and, turning his horse's head,
rode up to the bench, lifting his hat as he came.</p>
<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Frowenfeld."</p>
<p>Joseph, looking brighter than when he sat unaccosted, rose and
blushed.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld, you know my uncle very well, I
believe--Agricole Fusilier--long beard?"</p>
<p>"Oh! yes, sir, certainly."</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Frowenfeld, I shall be much obliged if you will tell
him--that is, should you meet him this evening--that I wish to see
him. If you will be so kind?"</p>
<p>"Oh! yes, sir, certainly."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's diffidence made itself evident in this reiterated
phrase.</p>
<p>"I do not know that you will see him, but if you should, you
know--"</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly, sir!"</p>
<p>The two paused a single instant, exchanging a smile of amiable
reminder from the horseman and of bashful but pleased
acknowledgment from the one who saw his precepts being reduced to
practice.</p>
<p>"Well, good-evening, Mr. Frowenfeld."</p>
<p>M. Grandissime lifted his hat and turned. Frowenfeld sat
down.</p>
<p>"<i>Bou zou, Mich&eacute; Honor&eacute;!</i>" called the
<i>marchande</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Comment to y&eacute;, Clemence?</i>"</p>
<p>The merchant waved his hand as he rode away with his
companion.</p>
<p>"<i>Beau Mich&eacute;, l&agrave;</i>," said the
<i>marchande</i>, catching Joseph's eye.</p>
<p>He smiled his ignorance and shook his head.</p>
<p>"Dass one fine gen'leman," she repeated. "<i>Mo pa'l&eacute;
Angl&eacute;</i>," she added with a chuckle.</p>
<p>"You know him?"</p>
<p>"Oh! yass, sah; Mawse Honor&eacute; knows me, yass. All de
gen'lemens knows me. I sell de <i>calas;</i> mawnin's sell
<i>calas</i>, evenin's sell zinzer-cake. <i>You</i> know me" (a
fact which Joseph had all along been aware of). "Dat me w'at pass
in rue Royale ev'y mawnin' holl'in' '<i>B&eacute; calas touts
chauds</i>,' an' singin'; don't you know?"</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of an artist overcame any timidity she might have
been supposed to possess, and, waiving the formality of an
invitation, she began, to Frowenfeld's consternation, to sing, in a
loud, nasal voice.</p>
<p>But the performance, long familiar, attracted no public
attention, and he for whose special delight it was intended had
taken an attitude of disclaimer and was again contemplating the
quiet groups of the Place d'Armes and the pleasant hurry of the
levee road.</p>
<p>"Don't you know?" persisted the woman. "Yass, sah, dass me; I's
Clemence."</p>
<p>But Frowenfeld was looking another way.</p>
<p>"You know my boy," suddenly said she.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld looked at her.</p>
<p>"Yass, sah. Dat boy w'at bring you de box of <i>basilic</i> lass
Chrismus; dass my boy."</p>
<p>She straightened her cakes on the tray and made some changes in
their arrangement that possibly were important.</p>
<p>"I learned to speak English in Fijinny. Bawn dah."</p>
<p>She looked steadily into the apothecary's absorbed countenance
for a full minute, then let her eyes wander down the highway. The
human tide was turning cityward. Presently she spoke again.</p>
<p>"Folks comin' home a'ready, yass."</p>
<p>Her hearer looked down the road.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice that, once heard, was always known,--deep and
pompous, as if a lion roared,--sounded so close behind him as to
startle him half from his seat.</p>
<p>"Is this a corporeal man, or must I doubt my eyes? Hah!
Professor Frowenfeld!" it said.</p>
<p>"Mr. Fusilier!" exclaimed Frowenfeld in a subdued voice, while
he blushed again and looked at the new-comer with that sort of awe
which children experience in a menagerie.</p>
<p>"<i>Citizen</i> Fusilier," said the lion.</p>
<p>Agricola indulged to excess the grim hypocrisy of brandishing
the catchwords of new-fangled reforms; they served to spice a
breath that was strong with the praise of the "superior liberties
of Europe,"--those old, cast-iron tyrannies to get rid of which
America was settled.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld smiled amusedly and apologetically at the same
moment.</p>
<p>"I am glad to meet you. I--"</p>
<p>He was going on to give Honor&eacute; Grandissime's message, but
was interrupted.</p>
<p>"My young friend," rumbled the old man in his deepest key,
smiling emotionally and holding and solemning continuing to shake
Joseph's hand, "I am sure you are. You ought to thank God that you
have my acquaintance."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld colored to the temples.</p>
<p>"I must acknowledge--" he began.</p>
<p>"Ah!" growled the lion, "your beautiful modesty leads you to
misconstrue me, sir. You pay my judgment no compliment. I know your
worth, sir; I merely meant, sir, that in me--poor, humble me--you
have secured a sympathizer in your tastes and plans. Agricola
Fusilier, sir, is not a cock on a dunghill, to find a jewel and
then scratch it aside."</p>
<p>The smile of diffidence, but not the flush, passed from the
young man's face, and he sat down forcibly.</p>
<p>"You jest," he said.</p>
<p>The reply was a majestic growl.</p>
<p>"I <i>never</i> jest!" The speaker half sat down, then
straightened up again. "Ah, the Marquis of Caso Calvo!--I must bow
to him, though an honest man's bow is more than he deserves."</p>
<p>"More than he deserves?" was Frowenfeld's query.</p>
<p>"More than he deserves!" was the response.</p>
<p>"What has he done? I have never heard----"</p>
<p>The denunciator turned upon Frowenfeld his most royal frown, and
retorted with a question which still grows wild in Louisiana:</p>
<p>"What"--he seemed to shake his mane--"what has he <i>not</i>
done, sir?" and then he withdrew his frown slowly, as if to add,
"You'll be careful next time how you cast doubt upon a public
official's guilt."</p>
<p>The marquis's cavalcade came briskly jingling by. Frowenfeld saw
within the carriage two men, one in citizen's dress, the other in a
brilliant uniform. The latter leaned forward, and, with a
cordiality which struck the young spectator as delightful, bowed.
The immigrant glanced at Citizen Fusilier, expecting to see the
greeting returned with great haughtiness; instead of which that
person uncovered his leonine head, and, with a solemn sweep of his
cocked hat, bowed half his length. Nay, he more than bowed, he
bowed down--so that the action hurt Frowenfeld from head to
foot.</p>
<p>"What large gentlemen was that sitting on the other side?" asked
the young man, as his companion sat down with the air of having
finished an oration.</p>
<p>"No gentleman at all!" thundered the citizen. "That fellow"
(beetling frown), "that <i>fellow</i> is Edward Livingston."</p>
<p>"The great lawyer?"</p>
<p>"The great villain!"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld himself frowned.</p>
<p>The old man laid a hand upon his junior's shoulder and growled
benignantly:</p>
<p>"My young friend, your displeasure delights me!"</p>
<p>The patience with which Frowenfeld was bearing all this forced a
chuckle and shake of the head from the <i>marchande</i>.</p>
<p>Citizen Fusilier went on speaking in a manner that might be
construed either as address or soliloquy, gesticulating much and
occasionally letting out a fervent word that made passers look
around and Joseph inwardly wince. With eyes closed and hands folded
on the top of the knotted staff which he carried but never used, he
delivered an apostrophe to the "spotless soul of youth," enticed by
the "spirit of adventure" to "launch away upon the unploughed sea
of the future!" He lifted one hand and smote the back of the other
solemnly, once, twice, and again, nodding his head faintly several
times without opening his eyes, as who should say, "Very
impressive; go on," and so resumed; spoke of this spotless soul of
youth searching under unknown latitudes for the "sunken treasures
of experience"; indulged, as the reporters of our day would say, in
"many beautiful nights of rhetoric," and finally depicted the
loathing with which the spotless soul of youth "recoils!"--suiting
the action to the word so emphatically as to make a pretty little
boy who stood gaping at him start back--"on encountering in the
holy chambers of public office the vultures hatched in the nests of
ambition and avarice!"</p>
<p>Three or four persons lingered carelessly near by with ears wide
open. Frowenfeld felt that he must bring this to an end, and, like
any young person who has learned neither deceit nor disrespect to
seniors, he attempted to reason it down.</p>
<p>"You do not think many of our public men are dishonest!"</p>
<p>"Sir!" replied the rhetorician, with a patronizing smile, "h-you
must be thinking of France!"</p>
<p>"No, sir; of Louisiana."</p>
<p>"Louisiana! Dishonest? All, sir, all. They are all as corrupt as
Olympus, sir!"</p>
<p>"Well," said Frowenfeld, with more feeling than was called for,
"there is one who, I feel sure, is pure. I know it by his
face!"</p>
<p>The old man gave a look of stern interrogation.</p>
<p>"Governor Claiborne."</p>
<p>"Ye-e-e g-hods! Claiborne! <i>Claiborne!</i> Why, he is a
Yankee!"</p>
<p>The lion glowered over the lamb like a thundercloud.</p>
<p>"He is a Virginian," said Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"He is an American, and no American can be honest."</p>
<p>"You are prejudiced," exclaimed the young man.</p>
<p>Citizen Fusilier made himself larger.</p>
<p>"What is prejudice? I do not know."</p>
<p>"I am an American myself," said Frowenfeld, rising up with his
face burning.</p>
<p>The citizen rose up also, but unruffled.</p>
<p>"My beloved young friend," laying his hand heavily upon the
other's shoulder, "you are not. You were merely born in
America."</p>
<p>But Frowenfeld was not appeased.</p>
<p>"Hear me through," persisted the flatterer. "You were merely
born in America. I, too, was born in America--but will any man
responsible for his opinion mistake me--Agricola Fusilier--for an
American?"</p>
<p>He clutched his cane in the middle and glared around, but no
person seemed to be making the mistake to which he so scornfully
alluded, and he was about to speak again when an outcry of alarm
coming simultaneously from Joseph and the <i>marchande</i> directed
his attention to a lady in danger.</p>
<p>The scene, as afterward recalled to the mind of the un-American
citizen, included the figures of his nephew and the new governor
returning up the road at a canter; but, at the time, he knew only
that a lady of unmistakable gentility, her back toward him, had
just gathered her robes and started to cross the road, when there
was a general cry of warning, and the <i>marchande</i> cried,
"<i>Garde choual!</i>" while the lady leaped directly into the
danger and his nephew's horse knocked her to the earth!</p>
<p>Though there was a rush to the rescue from every direction, she
was on her feet before any one could reach her, her lips
compressed, nostrils dilated, cheek burning, and eyes flashing a
lady's wrath upon a dismounted horseman. It was the governor. As
the crowd had rushed in, the startled horses, from whom the two
riders had instantly leaped, drew violently back, jerking their
masters with them and leaving only the governor in range of the
lady's angry eye.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle!" he cried, striving to reach her.</p>
<p>She pointed him in gasping indignation to his empty saddle, and,
as the crowd farther separated them, waved away all permission to
apologize and turned her back.</p>
<p>"Hah!" cried the crowd, echoing her humor.</p>
<p>"Lady," interposed the governor, "do not drive us to the
rudeness of leaving--"</p>
<p>"<i>Animal, vous!</i>" cried half a dozen, and the lady gave him
such a look of scorn that he did not finish his sentence.</p>
<p>"Open the way, there," called a voice in French.</p>
<p>It was Honor&eacute; Grandissime. But just then he saw that the
lady had found the best of protectors, and the two horsemen, having
no choice, remounted and rode away. As they did so, M. Grandissime
called something hurriedly to Frowenfeld, on whose arm the lady
hung, concerning the care of her; but his words were lost in the
short yell of derision sent after himself and his companion by the
crowd.</p>
<p>Old Agricola, meanwhile, was having a trouble of his own. He had
followed Joseph's wake as he pushed through the throng; but as the
lady turned her face he wheeled abruptly away. This brought again
into view the bench he had just left, whereupon he, in turn, cried
out, and, dashing through all obstructions, rushed back to it,
lifting his ugly staff as he went and flourishing it in the face of
Palmyre Philosophe.</p>
<p>She stood beside the seat with the smile of one foiled and
intensely conscious of peril, but neither frightened nor suppliant,
holding back with her eyes the execution of Agricola's threat
against her life.</p>
<p>Presently she drew a short step backward, then another, then a
third, and then turned and moved away down the avenue of willows,
followed for a few steps by the lion and by the laughing comment of
the <i>marchande</i>, who stood looking after them with her tray
balanced on her head.</p>
<p>"<i>Ya, ya! ye connais voudou bien!</i><a name=
"FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a>"</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1">[1]</a>
"They're up in the voudou arts."</blockquote>
<p>The old man turned to rejoin his companion. The day was rapidly
giving place to night and the people were withdrawing to their
homes. He crossed the levee, passed through the Place d'Armes and
on into the city without meeting the object of his search. For
Joseph and the lady had hurried off together.</p>
<p>As the populace floated away in knots of three, four and five,
those who had witnessed mademoiselle's (?) mishap told it to those
who had not; explaining that it was the accursed Yankee governor
who had designedly driven his horse at his utmost speed against the
fair victim (some of them butted against their hearers by way of
illustration); that the fiend had then maliciously laughed; that
this was all the Yankees came to New Orleans for, and that there
was an understanding among them--"Understanding, indeed!" exclaimed
one, "They have instructions from the President!"--that unprotected
ladies should be run down wherever overtaken. If you didn't believe
it you could ask the tyrant, Claiborne, himself; he made no secret
of it. One or two--but they were considered by others
extravagant--testified that, as the lady fell, they had seen his
face distorted with a horrid delight, and had heard him cry: "Daz
de way to knog them!"</p>
<p>"But how came a lady to be out on the levee, at sunset, on foot
and alone?" asked a citizen, and another replied--both using the
French of the late province:</p>
<p>"As for being on foot"--a shrug. "But she was not alone; she had
a <i>milatraisse</i> behind her."</p>
<p>"Ah! so; that was well."</p>
<p>"But--ha, ha!--the <i>milatraisse</i>, seeing her mistress out
of danger, takes the opportunity to try to bring the curse upon
Agricola Fusilier by sitting down where he had just risen up, and
had to get away from him as quickly as possible to save her own
skull."</p>
<p>"And left the lady?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and who took her to her home at last, but Frowenfeld, the
apothecary!"</p>
<p>"Ho, ho! the astrologer! We ought to hang that fellow."</p>
<p>"With his books tied to his feet," suggested a third citizen.
"It is no more than we owe to the community to go and smash his
show-window. He had better behave himself. Come, gentlemen, a
little <i>taffia</i> will do us good. When shall we ever get
through these exciting times?"</p>

<h3>STARLIGHT IN THE RUE CHARTRES</h3>
<br>
<p>"Oh! M'sieur Frowenfel', tague me ad home!"</p>
<p>It was Aurora, who caught the apothecary's arm vehemently in
both her hands with a look of beautiful terror. And whatever
Joseph's astronomy might have previously taught him to the
contrary, he knew by his senses that the earth thereupon turned
entirely over three times in two seconds.</p>
<p>His confused response, though unintelligible, answered all
purposes, as the lady found herself the next moment hurrying across
the Place d'Armes close to his side, and as they by-and-by passed
its farther limits she began to be conscious that she was clinging
to her protector as though she would climb up and hide under his
elbow. As they turned up the rue Chartres she broke the
silence.</p>
<p>"Oh!-h!"--breathlessly,--"'h!--M'sieur Frowenf'--you walkin' so
faz!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" echoed Frowenfeld, "I did not know what I was doing."</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the lady, "me, too, juz de sem lag you!
<i>attendez</i>; wait."</p>
<p>They halted; a moment's deft manipulation of a veil turned it
into a wrapping for her neck.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', oo dad man was? You know 'im?"</p>
<p>She returned her hand to Frowenfeld's arm and they moved on.</p>
<p>"The one who spoke to you, or--you know the one who got near
enough to apologize is not the one whose horse struck you!"</p>
<p>"I din know. But oo dad odder one? I saw h-only 'is back, bud I
thing it is de sem--"</p>
<p>She identified it with the back that was turned to her during
her last visit to Frowenfeld's shop; but finding herself about to
mention a matter so nearly connected with the purse of gold, she
checked herself; but Frowenfeld, eager to say a good word for his
acquaintance, ventured to extol his character while he concealed
his name.</p>
<p>"While I have never been introduced to him, I have some
acquaintance with him, and esteem him a noble gentleman."</p>
<p>"W'ere you meet him?"</p>
<p>"I met him first," he said, "at the graves of my parents and
sisters."</p>
<p>There was a kind of hush after the mention, and the lady made no
reply.</p>
<p>"It was some weeks after my loss," resumed Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"In wad <i>cimeti&egrave;re</i> dad was?"</p>
<p>"In no cemetery--being Protestants, you know--"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, sir?" with a gentle sigh.</p>
<p>"The physician who attended me procured permission to bury them
on some private land below the city."</p>
<p>"Not in de groun'<a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_2">[2]</a>?"</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor2">[2]</a>
Only Jews and paupers are buried in the ground in New
Orleans.</blockquote>
<p>"Yes; that was my father's expressed wish when he died."</p>
<p>"You 'ad de fivver? Oo nurse you w'en you was sick?"</p>
<p>"An old hired negress."</p>
<p>"Dad was all?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Hm-m-m!" she said piteously, and laughed in her sleeve.</p>
<p>Who could hope to catch and reproduce the continuous lively
thrill which traversed the frame of the escaped book-worm as every
moment there was repeated to his consciousness the knowledge that
he was walking across the vault of heaven with the evening star on
his arm--at least, that he was, at her instigation, killing time
along the dim, ill-lighted <i>trottoirs</i> of the rue Chartres,
with Aurora listening sympathetically at his side. But let it go;
also the sweet broken English with which she now and then
interrupted him; also the inward, hidden sparkle of her dancing
Gallic blood; her low, merry laugh; the roguish mental reservation
that lurked behind her graver speeches; the droll bravados she
uttered against the powers that be, as with timid fingers he
brushed from her shoulder a little remaining dust of the late
encounter--these things, we say, we let go,--as we let butterflies
go rather than pin them to paper.</p>
<p>They had turned into the rue Bienville, and were walking toward
the river, Frowenfeld in the midst of a long sentence, when a low
cry of tearful delight sounded in front of them, some one in long
robes glided forward, and he found his arm relieved of its burden
and that burden transferred to the bosom and passionate embrace of
another--we had almost said a fairer--Creole, amid a bewildering
interchange of kisses and a pelting shower of Creole French.</p>
<p>A moment after, Frowenfeld found himself introduced to "my
dotter, Clotilde," who all at once ceased her demonstrations of
affection and bowed to him with a majestic sweetness, that seemed
one instant grateful and the next, distant.</p>
<p>"I can hardly understand that you are not sisters," said
Frowenfeld, a little awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Ah! <i>ecoutez!</i>" exclaimed the younger.</p>
<p>"Ah! <i>par exemple!</i>" cried the elder, and they laughed down
each other's throats, while the immigrant blushed.</p>
<p>This encounter was presently followed by a silent surprise when
they stopped and turned before the door of Number 19, and
Frowenfeld contrasted the women with their painfully humble
dwelling. But therein is where your true Creole was, and still
continues to be, properly, yea, delightfully un-American; the
outside of his house may be as rough as the outside of a bird's
nest; it is the inside that is for the birds; and the front room of
this house, when the daughter presently threw open the batten
shutters of its single street door, looked as bright and happy,
with its candelabra glittering on the mantel, and its curtains of
snowy lace, as its bright-eyed tenants.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', if you pliz to come in," said Aurora, and
the timid apothecary would have bravely accepted the invitation,
but for a quick look which he saw the daughter give the mother;
whereupon he asked, instead, permission to call at some future day,
and received the cordial leave of Aurora and another bow from
Clotilde.</p>

<h3>THAT NIGHT</h3>
<br>
<p>Do we not fail to accord to our nights their true value? We are
ever giving to our days the credit and blame of all we do and
mis-do, forgetting those silent, glimmering hours when plans--and
sometimes plots--are laid; when resolutions are formed or changed;
when heaven, and sometimes heaven's enemies, are invoked; when
anger and evil thoughts are recalled, and sometimes hate made to
inflame and fester; when problems are solved, riddles guessed, and
things made apparent in the dark, which day refused to reveal. Our
nights are the keys to our days. They explain them. They are also
the day's correctors. Night's leisure untangles the mistakes of
day's haste. We should not attempt to comprise our pasts in the
phrase, "in those days;" we should rather say "in those days and
nights."</p>
<p>That night was a long-remembered one to the apothecary of the
rue Royale. But it was after he had closed his shop, and in his
back room sat pondering the unusual experiences of the evening,
that it began to be, in a higher degree, a night of events to most
of those persons who had a part in its earlier incidents.</p>
<p>That Honor&eacute; Grandissime whom Frowenfeld had only this day
learned to know as <i>the</i> Honor&eacute; Grandissime and the
young governor-general were closeted together.</p>
<p>"What can you expect, my-de'-seh?" the Creole was asking, as
they confronted each other in the smoke of their choice tobacco.
"Remember, they are citizens by compulsion. You say your best and
wisest law is that one prohibiting the slave-trade; my-de'-seh, I
assure you, privately, I agree with you; but they abhor your
law!</p>
<p>"Your principal danger--at least, I mean difficulty--is this:
that the Louisianais themselves, some in pure lawlessness, some
through loss of office, some in a vague hope of preserving the old
condition of things, will not only hold off from all participation
in your government, but will make all sympathy with it, all
advocacy of its principles, and especially all office-holding under
it, odious--disreputable--infamous. You may find yourself
constrained to fill your offices with men who can face down the
contumely of a whole people. You know what such men generally are.
One out of a hundred may be a moral hero--the ninety-nine will be
scamps; and the moral hero will most likely get his brains blown
out early in the day.</p>
<p>"Count O'Reilly, when he established the Spanish power here
thirty-five years ago, cut a similar knot with the executioner's
sword; but, my-de'-seh, you are here to establish a <i>free</i>
government; and how can you make it freer than the people wish it?
There is your riddle! They hold off and say, 'Make your government
as free as you can, but do not ask us to help you;' and before you
know it you have no retainers but a gang of shameless mercenaries,
who will desert you whenever the indignation of this people
overbalances their indolence; and you will fall the victim of what
you may call our mutinous patriotism."</p>
<p>The governor made a very quiet, unappreciative remark about a
"patriotism that lets its government get choked up with corruption
and then blows it out with gunpowder!"</p>
<p>The Creole shrugged.</p>
<p>"And repeats the operation indefinitely," he said.</p>
<p>The governor said something often heard, before and since, to
the effect that communities will not sacrifice themselves for mere
ideas.</p>
<p>"My-de'-seh," replied the Creole, "you speak like a true
Anglo-Saxon; but, sir! how many communities have <i>committed</i>
suicide. And this one?--why, it is <i>just</i> the kind to do
it!"</p>
<p>"Well," said the governor, smilingly, "you have pointed out what
you consider to be the breakers, now can you point out the
channel?"</p>
<p>"Channel? There is none! And you, nor I, cannot dig one. Two
great forces <i>may</i> ultimately do it, Religion and
Education--as I was telling you I said to my young friend, the
apothecary,--but still I am free to say what would be my first and
principal step, if I was in your place--as I thank God I am
not."</p>
<p>The listener asked him what that was.</p>
<p>"Wherever I could find a Creole that I could venture to trust,
my-de'-seh, I would put him in office. Never mind a little
political heterodoxy, you know; almost any man can be trusted to
shoot away from the uniform he has on. And then--"</p>
<p>"But," said the other, "I have offered you--"</p>
<p>"Oh!" replied the Creole, like a true merchant, "me, I am too
busy; it is impossible! But, I say, I would <i>compel</i>,
my-de'-seh, this people to govern themselves!"</p>
<p>"And pray, how would you give a people a free government and
then compel them to administer it?"</p>
<p>"My-de'-seh, you should not give one poor Creole the puzzle
which belongs to your whole Congress; but you may depend on this,
that the worst thing for all parties--and I say it only because it
is worst for all--would be a feeble and dilatory punishment of bad
faith."</p>
<p>When this interview finally drew to a close the governor had
made a memorandum of some fifteen or twenty Grandissimes, scattered
through different cantons of Louisiana, who, their kinsman
Honor&eacute; thought, would not decline appointments.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Certain of the Muses were abroad that night. Faintly audible to
the apothecary of the rue Royale through that deserted stillness
which is yet the marked peculiarity of New Orleans streets by
night, came from a neighboring slave-yard the monotonous chant and
machine-like tune-beat of an African dance. There our lately met
<i>marchande</i> (albeit she was but a guest, fortified against the
street-watch with her master's written "pass") led the ancient
Calinda dance with that well-known song of derision, in whose ever
multiplying stanzas the helpless satire of a feeble race still
continues to celebrate the personal failings of each newly
prominent figure among the dominant caste. There was a new distich
to the song to-night, signifying that the pride of the Grandissimes
must find his friends now among the Yankees:</p>
<blockquote>"Mich&eacute; Hon'r&eacute;, all&eacute;!
h-all&eacute;!<br>
Trouv&eacute; to zamis parmi les Yankis.<br>
Danc&eacute; calinda, bou-joum! bou-joum!<br>
Danc&eacute; calinda, bou-joum! bou-joum!</blockquote>
<p>Frowenfeld, as we have already said, had closed his shop, and
was sitting in the room behind it with one arm on his table and the
other on his celestial globe, watching the flicker of his small
fire and musing upon the unusual experiences of the evening. Upon
every side there seemed to start away from his turning glance the
multiplied shadows of something wrong. The melancholy face of that
Honor&eacute; Grandissime, his landlord, at whose mention Dr. Keene
had thought it fair to laugh without explaining; the tall,
bright-eyed <i>milatraisse</i>; old Agricola; the lady of the
basil; the newly identified merchant friend, now the more
satisfactory Honor&eacute;,--they all came before him in his
meditation, provoking among themselves a certain discord, faint but
persistent, to which he strove to close his ear. For he was
brain-weary. Even in the bright recollection of the lady and her
talk he became involved among shadows, and going from bad to worse,
seemed at length almost to gasp in an atmosphere of hints,
allusions, faint unspoken admissions, ill-concealed antipathies,
unfinished speeches, mistaken identities and whisperings of hidden
strife. The cathedral clock struck twelve and was answered again
from the convent belfry; and as the notes died away he suddenly
became aware that the weird, drowsy throb of the African song and
dance had been swinging drowsily in his brain for an unknown lapse
of time.</p>
<p>The apothecary nodded once or twice, and thereupon rose up and
prepared for bed, thinking to sleep till morning.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Aurora and her daughter had long ago put out their chamber
light. Early in the evening the younger had made favorable mention
of retiring, to which the elder replied by asking to be left awhile
to her own thoughts. Clotilde, after some tender protestations,
consented, and passed through the open door that showed, beyond it,
their couch. The air had grown just cool and humid enough to make
the warmth of one small brand on the hearth acceptable, and before
this the fair widow settled herself to gaze beyond her tiny,
slippered feet into its wavering flame, and think. Her thoughts
were such as to bestow upon her face that enhancement of beauty
that comes of pleasant reverie, and to make it certain that that
little city afforded no fairer sight,--unless, indeed, it was the
figure of Clotilde just beyond the open door, as in her white
nightdress, enriched with the work of a diligent needle, she knelt
upon the low <i>prie-Dieu</i> before the little family altar, and
committed her pure soul to the Divine keeping.</p>
<p>Clotilde could not have been many minutes asleep when Aurora
changed her mind and decided to follow. The shade upon her face had
deepened for a moment into a look of trouble; but a bright
philosophy, which was part of her paternal birthright, quickly
chased it away, and she passed to her room, disrobed, lay softly
down beside the beauty already there and smiled herself to
sleep,--</p>
<blockquote>"Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain,<br>
As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again."</blockquote>
<p>But she also wakened again, and lay beside her unconscious
bedmate, occupied with the company of her own thoughts. "Why should
these little concealments ruffle my bosom? Does not even Nature
herself practise wiles? Look at the innocent birds; do they build
where everybody can count their eggs? And shall a poor human
creature try to be better than a bird? Didn't I say my prayers
under the blanket just now?"</p>
<p>Her companion stirred in her sleep, and she rose upon one elbow
to bend upon the sleeper a gaze of ardent admiration. "Ah,
beautiful little chick! how guileless! indeed, how deficient in
that respect!" She sat up in the bed and hearkened; the bell struck
for midnight. Was that the hour? The fates were smiling! Surely M.
Assonquer himself must have wakened her to so choice an
opportunity. She ought not to despise it. Now, by the application
of another and easily wrought charm, that darkened hour lately
spent with Palmyre would have, as it were, its colors set.</p>
<p>The night had grown much cooler. Stealthily, by degrees, she
rose and left the couch. The openings of the room were a window and
two doors, and these, with much caution, she contrived to open
without noise. None of them exposed her to the possibility of
public view. One door looked into the dim front room; the window
let in only a flood of moonlight over the top of a high house which
was without openings on that side; the other door revealed a
weed-grown back yard, and that invaluable protector, the cook's
hound, lying fast asleep.</p>
<p>In her night-clothes as she was, she stood a moment in the
centre of the chamber, then sank upon one knee, rapped the floor
gently but audibly thrice, rose, drew a step backward, sank upon
the other knee, rapped thrice, rose again, stepped backward, knelt
the third time, the third time rapped, and then, rising, murmured a
vow to pour upon the ground next day an oblation of champagne--then
closed the doors and window and crept back to bed. Then she knew
how cold she had become. It seemed as though her very marrow was
frozen. She was seized with such an uncontrollable shivering that
Clotilde presently opened her eyes, threw her arm about her
mother's neck, and said:</p>
<p>"Ah! my sweet mother, are you so cold?"</p>
<p>"The blanket was all off of me," said the mother, returning the
embrace, and the two sank into unconsciousness together.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Into slumber sank almost at the same moment Joseph Frowenfeld.
He awoke, not a great while later, to find himself standing in the
middle of the floor. Three or four men had shouted at once, and
three pistol-shots, almost in one instant, had resounded just
outside his shop. He had barely time to throw himself into half his
garments when the knocker sounded on his street door, and when he
opened it Agricola Fusilier entered, supported by his nephew
Honor&eacute; on one side and Doctor Keene on the other. The
latter's right hand was pressed hard against a bloody place in
Agricola's side.</p>
<p>"Give us plenty of light, Frowenfeld," said the doctor, "and a
chair and some lint, and some Castile soap, and some towels and
sticking-plaster, and anything else you can think of. Agricola's
about scared to death--"</p>
<p>"Professor Frowenfeld," groaned the aged citizen, "I am basely
and mortally stabbed!"</p>
<p>"Right on, Frowenfeld," continued the doctor, "right on into the
back room. Fasten that front door. Here, Agricola, sit down here.
That's right, Frow., stir up a little fire. Give me--never mind,
I'll just cut the cloth open."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silent suspense while the wound was being
reached, and then the doctor spoke again.</p>
<p>"Just as I thought; only a safe and comfortable gash that will
keep you in-doors a while with your arm in a sling. You are more
scared than hurt, I think, old gentleman."</p>
<p>"You think an infernal falsehood, sir!"</p>
<p>"See here, sir," said the doctor, without ceasing to ply his
dexterous hands in his art, "I'll jab these scissors into your back
if you say that again."</p>
<p>"I suppose," growled the "citizen," "it is just the thing your
professional researches have qualified you for, sir!"</p>
<p>"Just stand here, Mr. Frowenfeld," said the little doctor,
settling down to a professional tone, "and hand me things as I ask
for them. Honor&eacute;, please hold this arm; so." And so, after a
moderate lapse of time, the treatment that medical science of those
days dictated was applied--whatever that was. Let those who do not
know give thanks.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime explained to Frowenfeld what had occurred.</p>
<p>"You see, I succeeded in meeting my uncle, and we went together
to my office. My uncle keeps his accounts with me. Sometimes we
look them over. We stayed until midnight; I dismissed my carriage.
As we walked homeward we met some friends coming out of the rooms
of the Bagatelle Club; five or six of my uncles and cousins, and
also Doctor Keene. We all fell a-talking of my grandfather's
<i>f&ecirc;te de grandp&egrave;re</i> of next month, and went to
have some coffee. When we separated, and my uncle and my cousin
Achille Grandissime and Doctor Keene and myself came down Royal
street, out from that dark alley behind your shop jumped a little
man and stuck my uncle with a knife. If I had not caught his arm he
would have killed my uncle."</p>
<p>"And he escaped," said the apothecary.</p>
<p>"No, sir!" said Agricola, with his back turned.</p>
<p>"I think he did. I do not think he was struck."</p>
<p>"And Mr.----, your cousin?"</p>
<p>"Achille? I have sent him for a carriage."</p>
<p>"Why, Agricola," said the doctor, snipping the loose ravellings
from his patient's bandages, "an old man like you should not have
enemies."</p>
<p>"I am <i>not</i> an old man, sir!"</p>
<p>"I said <i>young</i> man."</p>
<p>"I am not a <i>young</i> man, sir!"</p>
<p>"I wonder who the fellow was," continued Doctor Keene, as he
readjusted the ripped sleeve.</p>
<p>"That is <i>my</i> affair, sir; I know who it was."</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>"And yet she insists," M. Grandissime was asking Frowenfeld,
standing with his leg thrown across the celestial globe, "that I
knocked her down intentionally?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld, about to answer, was interrupted by a rap on the
door.</p>
<p>"That is my cousin, with the carriage," said M. Grandissime,
following the apothecary into the shop.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld opened to a young man,--a rather poor specimen of the
Grandissime type, deficient in stature but not in stage manner.</p>
<p>"<i>Est il mort</i>?" he cried at the threshold.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld, let me make you acquainted with my cousin,
Achille Grandissime."</p>
<p>Mr. Achille Grandissime gave Frowenfeld such a bow as we see now
only in pictures.</p>
<p>"Ve'y 'appe to meck, yo' acquaintenz!"</p>
<p>Agricola entered, followed by the doctor, and demanded in
indignant thunder-tones, as he entered:</p>
<p>"Who--ordered--that--carriage?"</p>
<p>"I did," said Honor&eacute;. "Will you please get into it at
once."</p>
<p>"Ah! dear Honor&eacute;!" exclaimed the old man, "always too
kind! I go in it purely to please you."</p>
<p>Good-night was exchanged; Honor&eacute; entered the vehicle and
Agricola was helped in. Achille touched his hat, bowed and waved
his hand to Joseph, and shook hands with the doctor, and saying,
"Well, good-night. Doctor Keene," he shut himself out of the shop
with another low bow. "Think I am going to shake hands with an
apothecary?" thought M. Achille.</p>
<p>Doctor Keene had refused Honor&eacute;'s invitation to go with
them.</p>
<p>"Frowenfeld," he said, as he stood in the middle of the shop
wiping a ring with a towel and looking at his delicate, freckled
hand, "I propose, before going to bed with you, to eat some of your
bread and cheese. Aren't you glad?"</p>
<p>"I shall be, Doctor," replied the apothecary, "if you will tell
me what all this means."</p>
<p>"Indeed I will not,--that is, not to-night. What? Why, it would
take until breakfast to tell what 'all this means,'--the story of
that pestiferous darky Bras Coup&eacute;, with the rest? Oh, no,
sir. I would sooner not have any bread and cheese. What on earth
has waked your curiosity so suddenly, anyhow?"</p>
<p>"Have you any idea who stabbed Citizen Fusilier?" was Joseph's
response.</p>
<p>"Why, at first I thought it was the other Honor&eacute;
Grandissime; but when I saw how small the fellow was, I was at a
loss, completely. But, whoever it is, he has my bullet in him,
whatever Honor&eacute; may think."</p>
<p>"Will Mr. Fusilier's wound give him much trouble?" asked Joseph,
as they sat down to a luncheon at the fire.</p>
<p>"Hardly; he has too much of the blood of Lufki-Humma in him. But
I need not say that; for the Grandissime blood is just as strong. A
wonderful family, those Grandissimes! They are an old, illustrious
line, and the strength that was once in the intellect and will is
going down into the muscles. I have an idea that their greatness
began, hundreds of years ago, in ponderosity of arm,--of frame,
say,--and developed from generation to generation, in a rising
scale, first into fineness of sinew, then, we will say, into force
of will, then into power of mind, then into subtleties of genius.
Now they are going back down the incline. Look at Honor&eacute;; he
is high up on the scale, intellectual and sagacious. But look at
him physically, too. What an exquisite mold! What compact strength!
I should not wonder if he gets that from the Indian Queen. What
endurance he has! He will probably go to his business by and by and
not see his bed for seventeen or eighteen hours. He is the flower
of the family, and possibly the last one. Now, old Agricola shows
the downward grade better. Seventy-five, if he is a day, with,
maybe, one-fourth the attainments he pretends to have, and still
less good sense; but strong--as an orang-outang. Shall we go to
bed?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>NEW LIGHT UPON DARK PLACES</h3>
<br>
<p>When the long, wakeful night was over, and the doctor gone,
Frowenfeld seated himself to record his usual observations of the
weather; but his mind was elsewhere--here, there, yonder. There are
understandings that expand, not imperceptibly hour by hour, but as
certain flowers do, by little explosive ruptures, with periods of
quiescence between. After this night of experiences it was natural
that Frowenfeld should find the circumference of his perceptions
consciously enlarged. The daylight shone, not into his shop alone,
but into his heart as well. The face of Aurora, which had been the
dawn to him before, was now a perfect sunrise, while in pleasant
timeliness had come in this Apollo of a Honor&eacute; Grandissime.
The young immigrant was dazzled. He felt a longing to rise up and
run forward in this flood of beams. He was unconscious of fatigue,
or nearly so--would, have been wholly so but for the return by and
by of that same dim shadow, or shadows, still rising and darting
across every motion of the fancy that grouped again the actors in
last night's scenes; not such shadows as naturally go with sunlight
to make it seem brighter, but a something which qualified the
light's perfection and the air's freshness.</p>
<p>Wherefore, resolved: that he would compound his life, from this
time forward, by a new formula: books, so much; observation, so
much; social intercourse, so much; love--as to that, time enough
for that in the future (if he was in love with anybody, he
certainly did not know it); of love, therefore, amount not yet
necessary to state, but probably (when it should be introduced), in
the generous proportion in which physicians prescribe <i>aqua</i>.
Resolved, in other words, without ceasing to be Frowenfeld the
studious, to begin at once the perusal of this newly found book,
the Community of New Orleans. True, he knew he should find it a
difficult task--not only that much of it was in a strange tongue,
but that it was a volume whose displaced leaves would have to be
lifted tenderly, blown free of much dust, re-arranged, some torn
fragments laid together again with much painstaking, and even the
purport of some pages guessed out. Obviously, the place to commence
at was that brightly illuminated title-page, the ladies
Nancanou.</p>
<p>As the sun rose and diffused its beams in an atmosphere whose
temperature had just been recorded as 50&deg; F., the apothecary
stepped half out of his shop-door to face the bracing air that came
blowing upon his tired forehead from the north. As he did so, he
said to himself:</p>
<p>"How are these two Honor&eacute; Grandissimes related to each
other, and why should one be thought capable of attempting the life
of Agricola?"</p>
<p>The answer was on its way to him.</p>
<p>There is left to our eyes but a poor vestige of the picturesque
view presented to those who looked down the rue Royale before the
garish day that changed the rue Enghien into Ingine street, and
dropped the 'e' from Royale. It was a long, narrowing perspective
of arcades, lattices, balconies, <i>zaguans</i>, dormer windows,
and blue sky--of low, tiled roofs, red and wrinkled, huddled down
into their own shadows; of canvas awnings with fluttering borders,
and of grimy lamp-posts twenty feet in height, each reaching out a
gaunt iron arm over the narrow street and dangling a lamp from its
end. The human life which dotted the view displayed a variety of
tints and costumes such as a painter would be glad to take just as
he found them: the gayly feathered Indian, the slashed and
tinselled Mexican, the leather-breeched raftsmen, the blue-or
yellow-turbaned <i>n&eacute;gresse</i>, the sugar-planter in white
flannel and moccasins, the average townsman in the last suit of
clothes of the lately deceased century, and now and then a
fashionable man in that costume whose union of tight-buttoned
martial severity, swathed throat, and effeminate superabundance of
fine linen seemed to offer a sort of state's evidence against the
pompous tyrannies and frivolities of the times.</p>
<p>The <i>marchande des calas</i> was out. She came toward Joseph's
shop, singing in a high-pitched nasal tone this new song:</p>
<blockquote>"D&eacute;'tit zozos--y&eacute; t&eacute; assis--<br>
D&eacute;'tit zozos--si la barrier.<br>
D&eacute;'tit zozos, qui zabott&eacute;;<br>
Qui &ccedil;a y&eacute; di' mo pas conn&eacute;.<br>
<br>
"Manzeur-poulet vini simin,<br>
Croup&eacute; si y&eacute; et croqu&eacute; y&eacute;;<br>
Personn' pli' 'tend' y&eacute; zabott&eacute;--<br>
D&eacute;'tit zozos si la barrier."</blockquote>
<p>"You lak dat song?" she asked, with a chuckle, as she let down
from her turbaned head a flat Indian basket of warm rice cakes.</p>
<p>"What does it mean?"</p>
<p>She laughed again--more than the questioner could see occasion
for.</p>
<p>"Dat mean--two lill birds; dey was sittin' on de fence an'
gabblin' togeddah, you know, lak you see two young gals sometime',
an' you can't mek out w'at dey sayin', even ef dey know demself?
H-ya! Chicken-hawk come 'long dat road an' jes' set down an' munch
'em, an' nobody can't no mo' hea' deir lill gabblin' on de fence,
you know."</p>
<p>Here she laughed again.</p>
<p>Joseph looked at her with severe suspicion, but she found refuge
in benevolence.</p>
<p>"Honey, you ought to be asleep dis werry minit; look lak folks
been a-worr'in' you. I's gwine to pick out de werry bes'
<i>calas</i> I's got for you."</p>
<p>As she delivered them she courtesied, first to Joseph and then,
lower and with hushed gravity, to a person who passed into the shop
behind him, bowing and murmuring politely as he passed. She
followed the new-comer with her eyes, hastily accepted the price of
the cakes, whispered, "Dat's my mawstah," lifted her basket to her
head and went away. Her master was Frowenfeld's landlord.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld entered after him, calas in hand, and with a grave
"Good-morning, sir."</p>
<p>"--m'sieu'," responded the landlord, with a low bow.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld waited in silence.</p>
<p>The landlord hesitated, looked around him, seemed about to
speak, smiled, and said, in his soft, solemn voice, feeling his way
word by word through the unfamiliar language:</p>
<p>"Ah lag to teg you apar'."</p>
<p>"See me alone?"</p>
<p>The landlord recognized his error by a fleeting smile.</p>
<p>"Alone," said he.</p>
<p>"Shall we go into my room?"</p>
<p>"<i>S'il vous plait, m'sieu'</i>."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's breakfast, furnished by contract from a neighboring
kitchen, stood on the table. It was a frugal one, but more
comfortable than formerly, and included coffee, that subject of
just pride in Creole cookery. Joseph deposited his <i>calas</i>
with these things and made haste to produce a chair, which his
visitor, as usual, declined.</p>
<p>"Idd you' bregfuz, m'sieu'."</p>
<p>"I can do that afterward," said Frowenfeld; but the landlord
insisted and turned away from him to look up at the books on the
wall, precisely as that other of the same name had done a few weeks
before.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld, as he broke his loaf, noticed this, and, as the
landlord turned his face to speak, wondered that he had not before
seen the common likeness.</p>
<p>"Dez stog," said the sombre man.</p>
<p>"What, sir? Oh!--dead stock? But how can the materials of an
education be dead stock?"</p>
<p>The landlord shrugged. He would not argue the point. One
American trait which the Creole is never entirely ready to
encounter is this gratuitous Yankee way of going straight to the
root of things.</p>
<p>"Dead stock in a mercantile sense, you mean," continued the
apothecary; "but are men right in measuring such things only by
their present market value?"</p>
<p>The landlord had no reply. It was little to him, his manner
intimated; his contemplation dwelt on deeper flaws in human right
and wrong; yet--but it was needless to discuss it. However, he did
speak.</p>
<p>"Ah was elevade in Pariz."</p>
<p>"Educated in Paris," exclaimed Joseph, admiringly. "Then you
certainly cannot find your education dead stock."</p>
<p>The grave, not amused, smile which was the landlord's only
rejoinder, though perfectly courteous, intimated that his tenant
was sailing over depths of the question that he was little aware
of. But the smile in a moment gave way for the look of one who was
engrossed with another subject.</p>
<p>"M'sieu'," he began; but just then Joseph made an apologetic
gesture and went forward to wait upon an inquirer after "Godfrey's
Cordial;" for that comforter was known to be obtainable at
"Frowenfeld's." The business of the American drug-store was daily
increasing. When Frowenfeld returned his landlord stood ready to
address him, with the air of having decided to make short of a
matter.</p>
<p>"M'sieu'----"</p>
<p>"Have a seat, sir," urged the apothecary.</p>
<p>His visitor again declined, with his uniform melancholy grace.
He drew close to Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"Ah wand you mague me one <i>ouangan</i>," he said.</p>
<p>Joseph shook his head. He remembered Doctor Keene's expressed
suspicion concerning the assault of the night before.</p>
<p>"I do not understand you, sir; what is that?"</p>
<p>"You know."</p>
<p>The landlord offered a heavy, persuading smile.</p>
<p>"An unguent? Is that what you mean--an ointment?"</p>
<p>"M'sieu'," said the applicant, with a not-to-be-deceived
expression, "<i>vous &ecirc;tes astrologue--magicien</i>--"</p>
<p>"God forbid!"</p>
<p>The landlord was grossly incredulous.</p>
<p>"You godd one 'P'tit Albert.'"</p>
<p>He dropped his forefinger upon an iron-clasped book on the
table, whose title much use had effaced.</p>
<p>"That is the Bible. I do not know what the Tee Albare is!"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld darted an aroused glance into the ever-courteous eyes
of his visitor, who said without a motion:</p>
<p>"You di'n't gave Agricola Fusilier <i>une ouangan, la nuit
pass&eacute;</i>?"</p>
<p>"Sir?"</p>
<p>"Ee was yeh?--laz nighd?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Fusilier was here last night--yes. He had been attacked by
an assassin and slightly wounded. He was accompanied by his nephew,
who, I suppose, is your cousin: he has the same name."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld, hoping he had changed the subject, concluded with a
propitiatory smile, which, however, was not reflected.</p>
<p>"Ma bruzzah," said the visitor.</p>
<p>"Your brother!"</p>
<p>"Ma whide bruzzah; ah ham nod whide, m'sieu'."</p>
<p>Joseph said nothing. He was too much awed to speak; the
ejaculation that started toward his lips turned back and rushed
into his heart, and it was the quadroon who, after a moment, broke
the silence:</p>
<p>"Ah ham de holdez son of Numa Grandissime."</p>
<p>"Yes--yes," said Frowenfeld, as if he would wave away something
terrible.</p>
<p>"Nod sell me--<i>ouangan</i>?" asked the landlord, again.</p>
<p>"Sir," exclaimed Frowenfeld, taking a step backward, "pardon me
if I offend you; that mixture of blood which draws upon you the
scorn of this community is to me nothing--nothing! And every
invidious distinction made against you on that account I despise!
But, sir, whatever may be either your private wrongs, or the wrongs
you suffer in common with your class, if you have it in your mind
to employ any manner of secret art against the interests or person
of any one--"</p>
<p>The landlord was making silent protestations, and his tenant,
lost in a wilderness of indignant emotions, stopped.</p>
<p>"M'sieu'," began the quadroon, but ceased and stood with an
expression of annoyance every moment deepening on his face, until
he finally shook his head slowly, and said with a baffled smile:
"Ah can nod spig Engliss."</p>
<p>"Write it," said Frowenfeld, lifting forward a chair.</p>
<p>The landlord, for the first time in their acquaintance, accepted
a seat, bowing low as he did so, with a demonstration of profound
gratitude that just perceptibly heightened his even dignity. Paper,
quills, and ink were handed down from a shelf and Joseph retired
into the shop.</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; Grandissime, f.m.c. (these initials could hardly
have come into use until some months later, but the convenience
covers the sin of the slight anachronism), Honor&eacute;
Grandissime, free man of color, entered from the rear room so
silently that Joseph was first made aware of his presence by
feeling him at his elbow. He handed the apothecary--but a few words
in time, lest we misjudge.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>The father of the two Honor&eacute;s was that Numa
Grandissime--that mere child--whom the Grand Marquis, to the great
chagrin of the De Grapions, had so early cadetted. The commission
seems not to have been thrown away. While the province was still in
first hands, Numa's was a shining name in the annals of Kerlerec's
unsatisfactory Indian wars; and in 1768 (when the colonists,
ill-informed, inflammable, and long ill-governed, resisted the
transfer of Louisiana to Spain), at a time of life when most young
men absorb all the political extravagances of their day, he had
stood by the side of law and government, though the popular cry was
a frenzied one for "liberty." Moreover, he had held back his whole
chafing and stamping tribe from a precipice of disaster, and had
secured valuable recognition of their office-holding capacities
from that really good governor and princely Irishman whose one act
of summary vengeance upon a few insurgent office-coveters has
branded him in history as Cruel O'Reilly. But the experience of
those days turned Numa gray, and withal he was not satisfied with
their outcome. In the midst of the struggle he had weakened in one
manly resolve--against his will he married. The lady was a
Fusilier, Agricola's sister, a person of rare intelligence and
beauty, whom, from early childhood, the secret counsels of his
seniors had assigned to him. Despite this, he had said he would
never marry; he made, he said, no pretensions to severe
conscientiousness, or to being better than others, but--as between
his Maker and himself--he had forfeited the right to wed, they all
knew how. But the Fusiliers had become very angry and Numa, finding
strife about to ensue just when without unity he could not bring an
undivided clan through the torrent of the revolution, had "nobly
sacrificed a little sentimental feeling," as his family defined it,
by breaking faith with the mother of the man now standing at Joseph
Frowenfeld's elbow, and who was then a little toddling boy. It was
necessary to save the party--nay, that was a slip; we should say,
to save the family; this is not a parable. Yet Numa loved his wife.
She bore him a boy and a girl, twins; and as her son grew in
physical, intellectual, and moral symmetry, he indulged the hope
that--the ambition and pride of all the various Grandissimes now
centering in this lawful son, and all strife being lulled--he
should yet see this Honor&eacute; right the wrongs which he had not
quite dared to uproot. And Honor&eacute; inherited the hope and
began to make it an intention and aim even before his departure
(with his half-brother the other Honor&eacute;) for school in
Paris, at the early age of fifteen. Numa soon after died, and
Honor&eacute;, after various fortunes in Paris, London, and
elsewhere, in the care, or at least company, of a pious uncle in
holy orders, returned to the ancestral mansion. The father's
will--by the law they might have set it aside, but that was not
their way--left the darker Honor&eacute; the bulk of his fortune,
the younger a competency. The latter--instead of taking office, as
an ancient Grandissime should have done--to the dismay and
mortification of his kindred, established himself in a prosperous
commercial business. The elder bought houses and became a
<i>rentier</i>.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>The landlord handed the apothecary the following writing:</p>
<blockquote>MR. JOSEPH FROWENFELD:<br>
<br>
Think not that anybody is to be either poisoned by me nor yet to be
made a sufferer by the exercise of anything by me of the character
of what is generally known as grigri, otherwise magique. This, sir,
I do beg your permission to offer my assurance to you of the same.
Ah, no! it is not for that! I am the victim of another entirely and
a far differente and dissimilar passion, <i>i.e.</i>, Love.
Esteemed sir, speaking or writing to you as unto the only man of
exclusively white blood whom I believe is in Louisiana willing to
do my dumb, suffering race the real justice, I love Palmyre la
Philosophe with a madness which is by the human lips or tongues not
possible to be exclaimed (as, I may add, that I have in the same
like manner since exactley nine years and seven months and some
days). Alas! heavens! I can't help it in the least particles at
all! What, what shall I do, for ah! it is pitiful! She loves me not
at all, but, on the other hand, is (if I suspicion not wrongfully)
wrapped up head and ears in devotion of one who does not love her,
either, so cold and incapable of appreciation is he. I allude to
Honor&eacute; Grandissime.<br>
<br>
Ah! well do I remember the day when we returned--he and me--from
the France. She was there when we landed on that levee, she was
among that throng of kindreds and domestiques, she shind like the
evening star as she stood there (it was the first time I saw her,
but she was known to him when at fifteen he left his home, but I
resided not under my own white father's roof--not at all--far from
that). She cried out "A la fin to vini!" and leap herself with both
resplendant arm around his neck and kist him twice on the one cheek
and the other, and her resplendant eyes shining with a so great
beauty.<br>
<br>
If you will give me a <i>poudre d'amour</i> such as I doubt not
your great knowledge enable you to make of a power that cannot to
be resist, while still at the same time of a harmless character
toward the life or the health of such that I shall succeed in its
use to gain the affections of that emperice of my soul, I hesitate
not to give you such price as it may please you to nominate up as
high as to $l,000--nay, more. Sir, will you do that?<br>
<br>
I have the honor to remain, sir,<br>
<br>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>
<br>
H. Grandissime.</blockquote>
<p>Frowenfeld slowly transferred his gaze from the paper to his
landlord's face. Dejection and hope struggled with each other in
the gaze that was returned; but when Joseph said, with a
countenance full of pity, "I have no power to help you," the
disappointed lover merely looked fixedly for a moment in the
direction of the street, then lifted his hat toward his head,
bowed, and departed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>ART AND COMMERCE</h3>
<br>
<p>It was some two or three days after the interview just related
that the apothecary of the rue Royale found it necessary to ask a
friend to sit in the shop a few minutes while he should go on a
short errand. He was kept away somewhat longer than he had intended
to stay, for, as they were coming out of the cathedral, he met
Aurora and Clotilde. Both the ladies greeted him with a cordiality
which was almost inebriating, Aurora even extending her hand. He
stood but a moment, responding blushingly to two or three trivial
questions from her; yet even in so short a time, and although
Clotilde gave ear with the sweetest smiles and loveliest changes of
countenance, he experienced a lively renewal of a conviction that
this young lady was most unjustly harboring toward him a vague
disrelish, if not a positive distrust. That she had some mental
reservation was certain.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'," said Aurora, as he raised his hat for
good-day, "you din come home yet."</p>
<p>He did not understand until he had crimsoned and answered he
knew not what--something about having intended every day. He felt
lifted he knew not where, Paradise opened, there was a flood of
glory, and then he was alone; the ladies, leaving adieus sweeter
than the perfume they carried away with them, floated into the
south and were gone. Why was it that the elder, though plainly
regarded by the younger with admiration, dependence, and
overflowing affection, seemed sometimes to be, one might almost
say, watched by her? He liked Aurora the better.</p>
<p>On his return to the shop his friend remarked that if he
received many such visitors as the one who had called during his
absence, he might be permitted to be vain. It was Honor&eacute;
Grandissime, and he had left no message.</p>
<p>"Frowenfeld," said his friend, "it would pay you to employ a
regular assistant."</p>
<p>Joseph was in an abstracted mood.</p>
<p>"I have some thought of doing so."</p>
<p>Unlucky slip! As he pushed open his door next morning, what was
his dismay to find himself confronted by some forty men. Five of
them leaped up from the door-sill, and some thirty-five from the
edge of the <i>trottoir</i>, brushed that part of their
wearing-apparel which always fits with great neatness on a Creole,
and trooped into the shop. The apothecary fell behind his defences,
that is to say, his prescription desk, and explained to them in a
short and spirited address that he did not wish to employ any of
them on any terms. Nine-tenths of them understood not a word of
English; but his gesture was unmistakable. They bowed gratefully,
and said good-day.</p>
<p>Now Frowenfeld did these young men an injustice; and though they
were far from letting him know it, some of them felt it and
interchanged expressions of feeling reproachful to him as they
stopped on the next corner to watch a man painting a sign. He had
treated them as if they all wanted situations. Was this so? Far
from it. Only twenty men were applicants; the other twenty were
friends who had come to see them get the place. And again, though,
as the apothecary had said, none of them knew anything about the
drug business--no, nor about any other business under the
heavens--they were all willing that he should teach them--except
one. A young man of patrician softness and costly apparel tarried a
moment after the general exodus, and quickly concluded that on
Frowenfeld's account it was probably as well that he could not
qualify, since he was expecting from France an important government
appointment as soon as these troubles should be settled and
Louisiana restored to her former happy condition. But he had a
friend--a cousin--whom he would recommend, just the man for the
position; a splendid fellow; popular, accomplished--what? the best
trainer of dogs that M. Frowenfeld might ever hope to look upon; a
"so good fisherman as I never saw! "--the marvel of the
ball-room--could handle a partner of twice his weight; the speaker
had seen him take a lady so tall that his head hardly came up to
her bosom, whirl her in the waltz from right to left--this way! and
then, as quick as lightning, turn and whirl her this way, from left
to right--"so grezful ligue a peajohn! He could read and write, and
knew more comig song!"--the speaker would hasten to secure him
before he should take some other situation.</p>
<p>The wonderful waltzer never appeared upon the scene; yet Joseph
made shift to get along, and by and by found a man who partially
met his requirements. The way of it was this: With his forefinger
in a book which he had been reading, he was one day pacing his shop
floor in deep thought. There were two loose threads hanging from
the web of incident weaving around him which ought to connect
somewhere; but where? They were the two visits made to his shop by
the young merchant, Honor&eacute; Grandissime. He stopped still to
think; what "train of thought" could he have started in the mind of
such a man?</p>
<p>He was about to resume his walk, when there came in, or more
strictly speaking, there shot in, a young, auburn-curled, blue-eyed
man, whose adolescent buoyancy, as much as his delicate,
silver-buckled feet and clothes of perfect fit, pronounced him
all-pure Creole. His name, when it was presently heard, accounted
for the blond type by revealing a Franco-Celtic origin.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'," he said, advancing like a boy coming in
after recess, "I 'ave somet'ing beauteeful to place into yo'
window."</p>
<p>He wheeled half around as he spoke and seized from a naked black
boy, who at that instant entered, a rectangular object enveloped in
paper.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's window was fast growing to be a place of art
exposition. A pair of statuettes, a golden tobacco-box, a costly
jewel-casket, or a pair of richly gemmed horse-pistols--the
property of some ancient gentleman or dame of emaciated fortune,
and which must be sold to keep up the bravery of good clothes and
pomade that hid slow starvation--went into the shop-window of the
ever-obliging apothecary, to be disposed of by <i>tombola</i>. And
it is worthy of note in passing, concerning the moral education of
one who proposed to make no conscious compromise with any sort of
evil, that in this drivelling species of gambling he saw nothing
hurtful or improper. But "in Frowenfeld's window" appeared also
articles for simple sale or mere transient exhibition; as, for
instance, the wonderful tapestries of a blind widow of ninety;
tremulous little bunches of flowers, proudly stated to have been
made entirely of the bones of the ordinary catfish; others, large
and spreading, the sight of which would make any botanist fall down
"and die as mad as the wild waves be," whose ticketed merit was
that they were composed exclusively of materials produced upon
Creole soil; a picture of the Ursulines' convent and chapel, done
in forty-five minutes by a child of ten years, the daughter of the
widow Felicie Grandissime; and the siege of Troy, in ordinary ink,
done entirely with the pen, the labor of twenty years, by "a
citizen of New Orleans." It was natural that these things should
come to "Frowenfeld's corner," for there, oftener than elsewhere,
the critics were gathered together. Ah! wonderful men, those
critics; and, fortunately, we have a few still left.</p>
<p>The young man with auburn curls rested the edge of his burden
upon the counter, tore away its wrappings and disclosed a
painting.</p>
<p>He said nothing--with his mouth; but stood at arm's length
balancing the painting and casting now upon it and now upon Joseph
Frowenfeld a look more replete with triumph than Caesar's
three-worded dispatch.</p>
<p>The apothecary fixed upon it long and silently the gaze of a
somnambulist. At length he spoke:</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Louisiana rif-using to hanter de h-Union!" replied the Creole,
with an ecstasy that threatened to burst forth in hip-hurrahs.</p>
<p>Joseph said nothing, but silently wondered at Louisiana's
anatomy.</p>
<p>"Gran' subjec'!" said the Creole.</p>
<p>"Allegorical," replied the hard-pressed apothecary.</p>
<p>"Allegoricon? No, sir! Allegoricon never saw dat pigshoe. If you
insist to know who make dat pigshoe--de hartis' stan' bif-ore
you!"</p>

<br>
<p>"It is your work?"</p>
<p>"'Tis de work of me, Raoul Innerarity, cousin to de disting-wish
Honor&eacute; Grandissime. I swear to you, sir, on stack of Bible'
as 'igh as yo' head!"</p>
<p>He smote his breast.</p>
<p>"Do you wish to put it in the window?"</p>
<p>"Yes, seh."</p>
<p>"For sale?"</p>
<p>M. Raoul Innerarity hesitated a moment before replying:</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', I think it is a foolishness to be too proud,
eh? I want you to say, 'My frien', 'Sieur Innerarity, never care to
sell anything; 'tis for egs-hibby-shun'; <i>mais</i>--when somebody
look at it, so," the artist cast upon his work a look of
languishing covetousness, "'you say, <i>foudre tonnerre!</i> what
de dev'!--I take dat ris-pon-sibble-ty--you can have her for two
hun'red fifty dollah!' Better not be too proud, eh, 'Sieur
Frowenfel'?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," said Joseph, proceeding to place it in the window,
his new friend following him about spanielwise; "but you had better
let me say plainly that it is for sale."</p>
<p>"Oh--I don't care--<i>mais</i>--my rillation' will never forgive
me! <i>Mais</i>--go-ahead-I-don't-care! 'T is for sale."</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'," he resumed, as they came away from the
window, "one week ago"--he held up one finger--"what I was doing?
Makin' bill of ladin', my faith!--for my cousin Honor&eacute;! an'
now, I ham a hartis'! So soon I foun' dat, I say, 'Cousin
Honor&eacute;,'"--the eloquent speaker lifted his foot and
administered to the empty air a soft, polite kick--"I never goin'
to do anoder lick o' work so long I live; adieu!"</p>
<p>He lifted a kiss from his lips and wafted it in the direction of
his cousin's office.</p>
<p>"Mr. Innerarity," exclaimed the apothecary, "I fear you are
making a great mistake."</p>
<p>"You tink I hass too much?"</p>
<p>"Well, sir, to be candid, I do; but that is not your greatest
mistake."</p>
<p>"What she's worse?"</p>
<p>The apothecary simultaneously smiled and blushed.</p>
<p>"I would rather not say; it is a passably good example of Creole
art; there is but one way by which it can ever be worth what you
ask for it."</p>
<p>"What dat is?"</p>
<p>The smile faded and the blush deepened as Frowenfeld
replied:</p>
<p>"If it could become the means of reminding this community that
crude ability counts next to nothing in art, and that nothing else
in this world ought to work so hard as genius, it would be worth
thousands of dollars!"</p>
<p>"You tink she is worse a t'ousand dollah?" asked the Creole,
shadow and sunshine chasing each other across his face.</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>The unwilling critic strove unnecessarily against his smile.</p>
<p>"Ow much you tink?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Innerarity, as an exercise it is worth whatever truth or
skill it has taught you; to a judge of paintings it is ten dollars'
worth of paint thrown away; but as an article of sale it is worth
what it will bring without misrepresentation."</p>
<p>"Two--hun-rade an'--fifty--dollahs or--not'in'!" said the
indignant Creole, clenching one fist, and with the other hand
lifting his hat by the front corner and slapping it down upon the
counter. "Ha, ha, ha! a pase of waint--a wase of paint! 'Sieur
Frowenfel', you don' know not'in' 'bout it! You har a jedge of
painting?" he added cautiously.</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"<i>Eh, bien! foudre tonnerre</i>!--look yeh! you know? 'Sieur
Frowenfel'? Dat de way de publique halways talk about a hartis's
firs' pigshoe. But, I hass you to pardon me, Monsieur Frowenfel',
if I 'ave speak a lill too warm."</p>
<p>"Then you must forgive me if, in my desire to set you right, I
have spoken with too much liberty. I probably should have said only
what I first intended to say, that unless you are a person of
independent means--"</p>
<p>"You t'ink I would make bill of ladin'? Ah! Hm-m!"</p>
<p>"--that you had made a mistake in throwing up your means of
support--"</p>
<p>"But 'e 'as fill de place an' don' want me no mo'. You want a
clerk?--one what can speak fo' lang-widge--French, Eng-lish,
Spanish, <i>an'</i> Italienne? Come! I work for you in de mawnin'
an' paint in de evenin'; come!"</p>
<p>Joseph was taken unaware. He smiled, frowned, passed his hand
across his brow, noticed, for the first time since his delivery of
the picture, the naked little boy standing against the edge of a
door, said, "Why--," and smiled again.</p>
<p>"I riffer you to my cousin Honor&eacute;," said Innerarity.</p>
<p>"Have you any knowledge of this business?"</p>
<p>"I 'ave.'</p>
<p>"Can you keep shop in the forenoon or afternoon indifferently,
as I may require?"</p>
<p>"Eh? Forenoon--afternoon?" was the reply.</p>
<p>"Can you paint sometimes in the morning and keep shop in the
evening?"</p>
<p>"Yes, seh."</p>
<p>Minor details were arranged on the spot. Raoul dismissed the
black boy, took off his coat and fell to work decanting something,
with the understanding that his salary, a microscopic one, should
begin from date if his cousin should recommend him.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'," he called from under the counter, later in
the day, "you t'ink it would be hanny disgrace to paint de pigshoe
of a niggah?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"Ah, my soul! what a pigshoe I could paint of

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A VERY NATURAL MISTAKE</h3>
<br>
<p>MR. Raoul Innerarity proved a treasure. The fact became patent
in a few hours. To a student of the community he was a key, a lamp,
a lexicon, a microscope, a tabulated statement, a book of heraldry,
a city directory, a glass of wine, a Book of Days, a pair of wings,
a comic almanac, a diving bell, a Creole <i>veritas</i>. Before the
day had had time to cool, his continual stream of words had done
more to elucidate the mysteries in which his employer had begun to
be befogged than half a year of the apothecary's slow and
scrupulous guessing. It was like showing how to carve a strange
fowl. The way he dovetailed story into story and drew forward in
panoramic procession Lufki-Humma and Epaminondas Fusilier, Zephyr
Grandissime and the lady of the <i>lettre de cachet</i>,
Demosthenes De Grapion and the <i>fille &agrave;
l'h&ocirc;pital</i>, Georges De Grapion and the <i>fille &agrave;
la cassette</i>, Numa Grandissime, father of the two
Honor&eacute;s, young Nancanou and old Agricola,--the way he made
them</p>
<blockquote>"Knit hands and beat the ground<br>
In a light, fantastic round,"</blockquote>
<p>would have shamed the skilled volubility of Sheharazade.</p>
<p>"Look!" said the story-teller, summing up; "you take hanny
'istory of France an' see the hage of my familie. Pipple talk about
de Boulignys, de Sauv&eacute;s, de Grandpr&egrave;s, de Lemoynes,
de St. Maxents,--bla-a-a! De Grandissimes is as hole as de dev'!
What? De mose of de Creole families is not so hold as plenty of my
yallah kinfolks!"</p>
<p>The apothecary found very soon that a little salt improved M.
Raoul's statements.</p>
<p>But here he was, a perfect treasure, and Frowenfeld, fleeing
before his illimitable talking power in order to digest in
seclusion the ancestral episodes of the Grandissimes and De
Grapions, laid pleasant plans for the immediate future. To-morrow
morning he would leave the shop in Raoul's care and call on M.
Honor&eacute; Grandissime to advise with him concerning the
retention of the born artist as a drug-clerk. To-morrow evening he
would pluck courage and force his large but bashful feet up to the
doorstep of Number 19 rue Bienville. And the next evening he would
go and see what might be the matter with Doctor Keene, who had
looked ill on last parting with the evening group that lounged in
Frowenfeld's door, some three days before. The intermediate hours
were to be devoted, of course, to the prescription desk and his
"dead stock."</p>
<p>And yet after this order of movement had been thus compactly
planned, there all the more seemed still to be that abroad which,
now on this side, and now on that, was urging him in a nervous
whisper to make haste. There had escaped into the air, it seemed,
and was gliding about, the expectation of a crisis.</p>
<p>Such a feeling would have been natural enough to the tenants of
Number 19 rue Bienville, now spending the tenth of the eighteen
days of grace allowed them in which to save their little fortress.
For Palmyre's assurance that the candle burning would certainly
cause the rent-money to be forthcoming in time was to Clotilde
unknown, and to Aurora it was poor stuff to make peace of mind of.
But there was a degree of impracticability in these ladies, which,
if it was unfortunate, was, nevertheless, a part of their Creole
beauty, and made the absence of any really brilliant outlook what
the galaxy makes a moonless sky. Perhaps they had not been as
diligent as they might have been in canvassing all possible ways
and means for meeting the pecuniary emergency so fast bearing down
upon them. From a Creole standpoint, they were not bad managers.
They could dress delightfully on an incredibly small outlay; could
wear a well-to-do smile over an inward sigh of stifled hunger;
could tell the parents of their one or two scholars to consult
their convenience, and then come home to a table that would make
any kind soul weep; but as to estimating the velocity of
bills-payable in their orbits, such trained sagacity was not
theirs. Their economy knew how to avoid what the Creole-African
apothegm calls <i>commerce Man Lizon--qui asset&eacute; pou' trois
picaillons et vend' pou' ein escalin</i> (bought for three
picayunes and sold for two); but it was an economy that made their
very hound a Spartan; for, had that economy been half as wise as it
was heroic, his one meal a day would not always have been the
cook's leavings of cold rice and the lickings of the gumbo
plates.</p>
<p>On the morning fixed by Joseph Frowenfeld for calling on M.
Grandissime, on the banquette of the rue Toulouse, directly in
front of an old Spanish archway and opposite a blacksmith's
shop,--this blacksmith's shop stood between a jeweller's store and
a large, balconied and dormer-windowed wine-warehouse--Aurore
Nancanou, closely veiled, had halted in a hesitating way and was
inquiring of a gigantic negro cartman the whereabouts of the
counting-room of M. Honor&eacute; Grandissime.</p>
<p>Before he could respond she descried the name upon a staircase
within the archway, and, thanking the cartman as she would have
thanked a prince, hastened to ascend. An inspiring smell of warm
rusks, coming from a bakery in the paved court below, rushed
through the archway and up the stair and accompanied her into the
cemetery-like silence of the counting-room. There were in the
department some fourteen clerks. It was a den of Grandissimes. More
than half of them were men beyond middle life, and some were yet
older. One or two were so handsome, under their noble silvery
locks, that almost any woman--Clotilde, for instance,--would have
thought, "No doubt that one, or that one, is the head of the
house." Aurora approached the railing which shut in the silent
toilers and directed her eyes to the farthest corner of the room.
There sat there at a large desk a thin, sickly-looking man with
very sore eyes and two pairs of spectacles, plying a quill with a
privileged loudness.</p>
<p>"H-h-m-m!" said she, very softly.</p>
<p>A young man laid down his rule and stepped to the rail with a
silent bow. His face showed a jaded look. Night revelry, rather
than care or years, had wrinkled it; but his bow was high-bred.</p>
<p>"Madame,"--in an undertone.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, it is M. Grandissime whom I wish to see," she said in
French.</p>
<p>But the young man responded in English.</p>
<p>"You har one tenant, ent it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, seh."</p>
<p>"Zen eet ees M. De Brahmin zat you 'ave to see."</p>
<p>"No, seh; M. Grandissime."</p>
<p>"M. Grandissime nevva see one tenant."</p>
<p>"I muz see M. Grandissime."</p>
<p>Aurora lifted her veil and laid it up on her bonnet.</p>
<p>The clerk immediately crossed the floor to the distant desk. The
quill of the sore-eyed man scratched louder--scratch, scratch--as
though it were trying to scratch under the door of Number 19 rue
Bienville--for a moment, and then ceased. The clerk, with one hand
behind him and one touching the desk, murmured a few words, to
which the other, after glancing under his arm at Aurora, gave a
short, low reply and resumed his pen. The clerk returned, came
through a gateway in the railing, led the way into a rich inner
room, and turning with another courtly bow, handed her a cushioned
armchair and retired.</p>
<p>"After eighteen years," thought Aurora, as she found herself
alone. It had been eighteen years since any representative of the
De Grapion line had met a Grandissime face to face, so far as she
knew; even that representative was only her deceased husband, a
mere connection by marriage. How many years it was since her
grandfather, Georges De Grapion, captain of dragoons, had had his
fatal meeting with a Mandarin de Grandissime, she did not remember.
There, opposite her on the wall, was the portrait of a young man in
a corslet who might have been M. Mandarin himself. She felt the
blood of her race growing warmer in her veins. "Insolent tribe,"
she said, without speaking, "we have no more men left to fight you;
but now wait. See what a woman can do."</p>
<p>These thoughts ran through her mind as her eye passed from one
object to another. Something reminded her of Frowenfeld, and, with
mingled defiance at her inherited enemies and amusement at the
apothecary, she indulged in a quiet smile. The smile was still
there as her glance in its gradual sweep reached a small
mirror.</p>
<p>She almost leaped from her seat.</p>
<p>Not because that mirror revealed a recess which she had not
previously noticed; not because behind a costly desk therein sat a
youngish man, reading a letter; not because he might have been
observing her, for it was altogether likely that, to avoid
premature interruption, he had avoided looking up; nor because this
was evidently Honor&eacute; Grandissime; but because Honor&eacute;
Grandissime, if this were he, was the same person whom she had seen
only with his back turned in the pharmacy--the rider whose horse
ten days ago had knocked her down, the Lieutenant of Dragoons who
had unmasked and to whom she had unmasked at the ball! Fly! But
where? How? It was too late; she had not even time to lower her
veil. M. Grandissime looked up at the glass, dropped the letter
with a slight start of consternation and advanced quickly toward
her. For an instant her embarrassment showed itself in a mantling
blush and a distressful yearning to escape; but the next moment she
rose, all a-flutter within, it is true, but with a face as nearly
sedate as the inborn witchery of her eyes would allow.</p>
<p>He spoke in Parisian French:</p>
<p>"Please be seated, madame."</p>
<p>She sank down.</p>
<p>"Do you wish to see me?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>She did not see her way out of this falsehood, but--she couldn't
say yes.</p>
<p>Silence followed.</p>
<p>"Whom do--"</p>
<p>"I wish to see M. Honor&eacute; Grandissime."</p>
<p>"That is my name, madame."</p>
<p>"Ah!"--with an angelic smile; she had collected her wits now,
and was ready for war. "You are not one of his clerks?"</p>
<p>M. Grandissime smiled softly, while he said to himself: "You
little honey-bee, you want to sting me, eh?" and then he answered
her question.</p>
<p>"No, madame; I am the gentleman you are looking for."</p>
<p>"The gentleman she was look--" her pride resented the fact.
"Me!"--thought she--"I am the lady whom, I have not a doubt, you
have been longing to meet ever since the ball;" but her look was
unmoved gravity. She touched her handkerchief to her lips and
handed him the rent notice.</p>
<p>"I received that from your office the Monday before last."</p>
<p>There was a slight emphasis in the announcement of the time; it
was the day of the run-over.</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; Grandissime, stopping with the rent-notice only
half unfolded, saw the advisability of calling up all the resources
of his sagacity and wit in order to answer wisely; and as they
answered his call a brighter nobility so overspread face and person
that Aurora inwardly exclaimed at it even while she exulted in her
thrust.</p>
<p>"Monday before last?"</p>
<p>She slightly bowed.</p>
<p>"A serious misfortune befell me that day," said M.
Grandissime.</p>
<p>"Ah?" replied the lady, raising her brows with polite distress,
"but you have entirely recovered, I suppose."</p>
<p>"It was I, madame, who that evening caused you a mortification
for which I fear you will accept no apology."</p>
<p>"On the contrary," said Aurora, with an air of generous
protestation, "it is I who should apologize; I fear I injured your
horse."</p>
<p>M. Grandissime only smiled, and opening the rent-notice dropped
his glance upon it while he said in a preoccupied tone:</p>
<p>"My horse is very well, I thank you."</p>
<p>But as he read the paper, his face assumed a serious air and he
seemed to take an unnecessary length of time to reach the bottom of
it.</p>
<p>"He is trying to think how he will get rid of me," thought
Aurora; "he is making up some pretext with which to dismiss me, and
when the tenth of March comes we shall be put into the street."</p>
<p>M. Grandissime extended the letter toward her, but she did not
lift her hands.</p>
<p>"I beg to assure you, madame, I could never have permitted this
notice to reach you from my office; I am not the Honor&eacute;
Grandissime for whom this is signed."</p>
<p>Aurora smiled in a way to signify clearly that that was just the
subterfuge she had been anticipating. Had she been at home she
would have thrown herself, face downward, upon the bed; but she
only smiled meditatively upward at the picture of an East Indian
harbor and made an unnecessary rearrangement of her handkerchief
under her folded hands.</p>
<p>"There are, you know,"--began Honor&eacute;, with a smile which
changed the meaning to "You know very well there are"--"two
Honor&eacute; Grandissimes. This one who sent you this letter is a
man of color--"</p>
<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Aurora, with a sudden malicious sparkle.</p>
<p>"If you will entrust this paper to me," said Honor&eacute;,
quietly, "I will see him and do now engage that you shall have no
further trouble about it. Of course, I do not mean that I will pay
it, myself; I dare not offer to take such a liberty."</p>
<p>Then he felt that a warm impulse had carried him a step too
far.</p>
<p>Aurora rose up with a refusal as firm as it was silent. She
neither smiled nor scintillated now, but wore an expression of
amiable practicality as she presently said, receiving back the
rent-notice as she spoke:</p>
<p>"I thank you, sir, but it might seem strange to him to find his
notice in the hands of a person who can claim no interest in the
matter. I shall have to attend to it myself."</p>
<p>"Ah! little enchantress," thought her grave-faced listener, as
he gave attention, "this, after all--ball and all--is the mood in
which you look your very, very best"--a fact which nobody knew
better than the enchantress herself.</p>
<p>He walked beside her toward the open door leading back into the
counting-room, and the dozen or more clerks, who, each by some
ingenuity of his own, managed to secure a glimpse of them, could
not fail to feel that they had never before seen quite so fair a
couple. But she dropped her veil, bowed M. Grandissime a polite "No
farther," and passed out.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime walked once up and down his private office, gave
the door a soft push with his foot and lighted a cigar.</p>
<p>The clerk who had before acted as usher came in and handed him a
slip of paper with a name written on it. M. Grandissime folded it
twice, gazed out the window, and finally nodded. The clerk
disappeared, and Joseph Frowenfeld paused an instant in the door
and then advanced, with a buoyant good-morning.</p>
<p>"Good-morning," responded M. Grandissime.</p>
<p>He smiled and extended his hand, yet there was a mechanical and
preoccupied air that was not what Joseph felt justified in
expecting.</p>
<p>"How can I serve you, Mr. Frhowenfeld?" asked the merchant,
glancing through into the counting-room. His coldness was almost
all in Joseph's imagination, but to the apothecary it seemed such
that he was nearly induced to walk away without answering. However,
he replied:</p>
<p>"A young man whom I have employed refers to you to recommend
him."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir? Prhay, who is that?"</p>
<p>"Your cousin, I believe, Mr. Raoul Innerarity."</p>
<p>M. Grandissime gave a low, short laugh, and took two steps
toward his desk.</p>
<p>"Rhaoul? Oh yes, I rhecommend Rhaoul to you. As an assistant in
yo' sto'?--the best man you could find."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir," said Joseph, coldly. "Good-morning!" he added
turning to go.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frhowenfeld," said the other, "do you evva rhide?"</p>
<p>"I used to ride," replied the apothecary, turning, hat in hand,
and wondering what such a question could mean.</p>
<p>"If I send a saddle-hoss to yo' do' on day aftah to-morrhow
evening at fo' o'clock, will you rhide out with me for-h about a
hour-h and a half--just for a little pleasu'e?"</p>
<p>Joseph was yet more astonished than before. He hesitated,
accepted the invitation, and once more said good-morning.</p>

<h3>DOCTOR KEENE RECOVERS HIS BULLET</h3>
<br>
<p>It early attracted the apothecary's notice, in observing the
civilization around him, that it kept the flimsy false bottoms in
its social errors only by incessant reiteration. As he re-entered
the shop, dissatisfied with himself for accepting M. Grandissime's
invitation to ride, he knew by the fervent words which he overheard
from the lips of his employee that the f.m.c. had been making one
of his reconnoisances, and possibly had ventured in to inquire for
his tenant.</p>
<p>"I t'ink, me, dat hanny w'ite man is a gen'leman; but I don't
care if a man are good like a h-angel, if 'e har not pu'e w'ite
'<i>ow can</i> 'e be a gen'leman?"</p>
<p>Raoul's words were addressed to a man who, as he rose up and
handed Frowenfeld a note, ratified the Creole's sentiment by a
spurt of tobacco juice and an affirmative "Hm-m."</p>
<p>The note was a lead-pencil scrawl, without date.</p>
<blockquote>DEAR JOE: Come and see me some time this evening.<br>
I am on my back in bed. Want your help in a little<br>
matter. Yours, Keene.<br>
<br>
I have found out who ---- ----"</blockquote>
<p>Frowenfeld pondered: "I have found out who ---- ----" Ah! Doctor
Keene had found out who stabbed Agricola.</p>
<p>Some delays occurred in the afternoon, but toward sunset the
apothecary dressed and went out. From the doctor's bedside in the
rue St. Louis, if not delayed beyond all expectation, he would
proceed to visit the ladies at Number 19 rue Bienville. The air was
growing cold and threatening bad weather.</p>
<p>He found the Doctor prostrate, wasted, hoarse, cross and almost
too weak for speech. He could only whisper, as his friend
approached his pillow:</p>
<p>"These vile lungs!"</p>
<p>"Hemorrhage?"</p>
<p>The invalid held up three small, freckled fingers.</p>
<p>Joseph dared not show pity in his gaze, but it seemed savage not
to express some feeling, so after standing a moment he began to
say:</p>
<p>"I am very sorry--"</p>
<p>"You needn't bother yourself!" whispered the doctor, who lay
frowning upward. By and by he whispered again.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld bent his ear, and the little man, so merry when well,
repeated, in a savage hiss:</p>
<p>"Sit down!"</p>
<p>It was some time before he again broke the silence.</p>
<p>"Tell you what I want--you to do--for me."</p>
<p>"Well, sir--"</p>
<p>"Hold on!" gasped the invalid, shutting his eyes with
impatience,--"till I get through."</p>
<p>He lay a little while motionless, and then drew from under his
pillow a wallet, and from the wallet a pistol-ball.</p>
<p>"Took that out--a badly neglected wound--last day I saw you."
Here a pause, an appalling cough, and by and by a whisper: "Knew
the bullet in an instant." He smiled wearily. "Peculiar size." He
made a feeble motion. Frowenfeld guessed the meaning of it and
handed him a pistol from a small table. The ball slipped softly
home. "Refused two hundred dollars--those pistols"--with a sigh and
closed eyes. By and by again--"Patient had smart fever--but it will
be gone--time you get--there. Want you to--take care--t' I get
up."</p>
<p>"But, Doctor--"</p>
<p>The sick man turned away his face with a petulant frown; but
presently, with an effort at self-control, brought it back and
whispered:</p>
<p>"You mean you--not physician?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"No. No more are half--doc's. You can do it. Simple gun-shot
wound in the shoulder." A rest. "Pretty wound; ranges"--he gave up
the effort to describe it. "You'll see it." Another rest. "You
see--this matter has been kept quiet so far. I don't want any
one--else to know--anything about it." He sighed audibly and looked
as though he had gone to sleep, but whispered again, with his eyes
closed--"'specially on culprit's own account."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld was silent: but the invalid was waiting for an
answer, and, not getting it, stirred peevishly.</p>
<p>"Do you wish me to go to-night?" asked the apothecary.</p>
<p>"To-morrow morning. Will you--?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, Doctor."</p>
<p>The invalid lay quite still for several minutes, looking
steadily at his friend, and finally let a faint smile play about
his mouth,--a wan reminder of his habitual roguery.</p>
<p>"Good boy," he whispered.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld rose and straightened the bedclothes, took a few
steps about the room, and finally returned. The Doctor's restless
eye had followed him at every movement.</p>
<p>"You'll go?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the apothecary, hat in hand; "where is it?"</p>
<p>"Corner Bienville and Bourbon,--upper river corner,--yellow
one-story house, doorsteps on street. You know the house?"</p>
<p>"I think I do."</p>
<p>"Good-night. Here!--I wish you would send that black girl in
here--as you go out--make me better fire--Joe!" the call was a
ghostly whisper.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld paused in the door.</p>
<p>"You don't mind my--bad manners, Joe?"</p>
<p>The apothecary gave one of his infrequent smiles.</p>
<p>"No, Doctor."</p>
<p>He started toward Number 19 rue Bienville, but a light, cold
sprinkle set in, and he turned back toward his shop. No sooner had
the rain got him there than it stopped, as rain sometimes will
do.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>WARS WITHIN THE BREAST</h3>
<br>
<p>The next morning came in frigid and gray. The unseasonable
numerals which the meteorologist recorded in his tables might have
provoked a superstitious lover of better weather to suppose that
Monsieur Danny, the head imp of discord, had been among the
a&euml;rial currents. The passionate southern sky, looking down and
seeing some six thousand to seventy-five hundred of her favorite
children disconcerted and shivering, tried in vain, for two hours,
to smile upon them with a little frozen sunshine, and finally burst
into tears.</p>
<p>In thus giving way to despondency, it is sad to say, the sky was
closely imitating the simultaneous behavior of Aurora Nancanou.
Never was pretty lady in cheerier mood than that in which she had
come home from Honor&eacute;'s counting-room. Hard would it be to
find the material with which to build again the castles-in-air that
she founded upon two or three little discoveries there made. Should
she tell them to Clotilde? Ah! and for what? No, Clotilde was a
dear daughter--ha! few women were capable of having such a daughter
as Clotilde; but there were things about which she was entirely too
scrupulous. So, when she came in from that errand profoundly
satisfied that she would in future hear no more about the rent than
she might choose to hear, she had been too shrewd to expose herself
to her daughter's catechising. She would save her little
revelations for disclosure when they might be used to advantage. As
she threw her bonnet upon the bed, she exclaimed, in a tone of
gentle and wearied reproach:</p>
<p>"Why did you not remind me that M. Honor&eacute; Grandissime,
that precious somebody-great, has the honor to rejoice in a
quadroon half-brother of the same illustrious name? Why did you not
remind me, eh?"</p>
<p>"Ah! and you know it as well as A, B, C," playfully retorted
Clotilde.</p>
<p>"Well, guess which one is our landlord?"</p>
<p>"Which one?"</p>
<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>! how do <i>I</i> know? I had to wait a shameful
long time to see <i>Monsieur le prince</i>,--just because I am a De
Grapion, I know. When at last I saw him, he says, 'Madame, this is
the other Honor&eacute; Grandissime.' There, you see we are the
victims of a conspiracy; if I go to the other, he will send me back
to the first. But, Clotilde, my darling," cried the beautiful
speaker, beamingly, "dismiss all fear and care; we shall have no
more trouble about it."</p>
<p>"And how, indeed, do you know that?"</p>
<p>"Something tells it to me in my ear. I feel it! Trust in
Providence, my child. Look at me, how happy I am; but you--you
never trust in Providence. That is why we have so much
trouble,--because you don't trust in Providence. Oh! I am so
hungry, let us have dinner."</p>
<p>"What sort of a person is M. Grandissime in his appearance?"
asked Clotilde, over their feeble excuse for a dinner.</p>
<p>"What sort? Do you imagine I had nothing better to do than
notice whether a Grandissime is good-looking or not? For all I know
to the contrary, he is--some more rice, please, my dear."</p>
<p>But this light-heartedness did not last long. It was based on an
unutterable secret, all her own, about which she still had
trembling doubts; this, too, notwithstanding her consultation of
the dark oracles. She was going to stop that. In the long run,
these charms and spells themselves bring bad luck. Moreover, the
practice, indulged in to excess, was wicked, and she had promised
Clotilde,--that droll little saint,--to resort to them no more.
Hereafter, she should do nothing of the sort, except, to be sure,
to take such ordinary precautions against misfortune as casting
upon the floor a little of whatever she might be eating or drinking
to propitiate M. Assonquer. She would have liked, could she have
done it without fear of detection, to pour upon the front door-sill
an oblation of beer sweetened with black molasses to Papa
L&eacute;bat (who keeps the invisible keys of all the doors that
admit suitors), but she dared not; and then, the hound would surely
have licked it up. Ah me! was she forgetting that she was a
widow?</p>
<p>She was in poor plight to meet the all but icy gray morning;
and, to make her misery still greater, she found, on dressing, that
an accident had overtaken her, which she knew to be a trustworthy
sign of love grown cold. She had lost--alas! how can we communicate
it in English!--a small piece of lute-string ribbon, about <i>so
long</i>, which she used for--not a necktie exactly, but--</p>
<p>And she hunted and hunted, and couldn't bear to give up the
search, and sat down to breakfast and ate nothing, and rose up and
searched again (not that she cared for the omen), and struck the
hound with the broom, and broke the broom, and hunted again, and
looked out the front window, and saw the rain beginning to fall,
and dropped into a chair--crying, "Oh! Clotilde, my child, my
child! the rent collector will be here Saturday and turn us into
the street!" and so fell a-weeping.</p>
<p>A little tear-letting lightened her unrevealable burden, and she
rose, rejoicing that Clotilde had happened to be out of
eye-and-ear-shot. The scanty fire in the fireplace was ample to
warm the room; the fire within her made it too insufferably hot!
Rain or no rain, she parted the window-curtains and lifted the
sash. What a mark for Love's arrow she was, as, at the window, she
stretched her two arms upward! And, "right so," who should chance
to come cantering by, the big drops of rain pattering after him,
but the knightliest man in that old town, and the fittest to
perfect the fine old-fashioned poetry of the scene!</p>
<p>"Clotilde," said Aurora, turning from her mirror, whither she
had hastened to see if her face showed signs of tears (Clotilde was
entering the room), "we shall never be turned out of this house by
Honor&eacute; Grandissime!"</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Clotilde, stopping short in the floor, forgetting
Aurora's trust in Providence, and expecting to hear that M.
Grandissime had been found dead in his bed.</p>
<p>"Because I saw him just now; he rode by on horseback. A man with
that noble face could never <i>do such a thing</i>!"</p>
<p>The astonished Clotilde looked at her mother searchingly. This
sort of speech about a Grandissime? But Aurora was the picture of
innocence.</p>
<p>Clotilde uttered a derisive laugh.</p>
<p>"<i>Impertinente</i>!" exclaimed the other, laboring not to join
in it.</p>
<p>"Ah-h-h!" cried Clotilde, in the same mood, "and what face had
he when he wrote that letter?"</p>
<p>"What face?"</p>
<p>"Yes, what face?"</p>
<p>"I do not know what face you mean," said Aurora.</p>
<p>"What face," repeated Clotilde, "had Monsieur Honor&eacute; de
Grandissime on the day that he wrote--"</p>
<p>"Ah, f-fah!" cried Aurora, and turned away, "you don't know what
you are talking about! You make me wish sometimes that I were
dead!"</p>
<p>Clotilde had gone and shut down the sash, as it began to rain
hard and blow. As she was turning away, her eye was attracted by an
object at a distance.</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Aurora, from a seat before the fire.</p>
<p>"Nothing," said Clotilde, weary of the sensational,--"a man in
the rain."</p>
<p>It was the apothecary of the rue Royale, turning from that
street toward the rue Bourbon, and bowing his head against the
swirling norther.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>FROWENFELD KEEPS HIS APPOINTMENT</h3>
<br>
<p>Doctor Keene, his ill-humor slept off, lay in bed in a quiescent
state of great mental enjoyment. At times he would smile and close
his eyes, open them again and murmur to himself, and turn his head
languidly and smile again. And when the rain and wind, all tangled
together, came against the window with a whirl and a slap, his
smile broadened almost to laughter.</p>
<p>"He's in it," he murmured, "he's just reaching there. I would
give fifty dollars to see him when he first gets into the house and
sees where he is."</p>
<p>As this wish was finding expression on the lips of the little
sick man, Joseph Frowenfeld was making room on a narrow doorstep
for the outward opening of a pair of small batten doors, upon which
he had knocked with the vigorous haste of a man in the rain. As
they parted, he hurriedly helped them open, darted within, heedless
of the odd black shape which shuffled out of his way, wheeled and
clapped them shut again, swung down the bar and then turned, and
with the good-natured face that properly goes with a ducking,
looked to see where he was.</p>
<p>One object--around which everything else instantly became
nothing--set his gaze. On the high bed, whose hangings of blue we
have already described, silently regarding the intruder with a pair
of eyes that sent an icy thrill through him and fastened him where
he stood, lay Palmyre Philosophe. Her dress was a long, snowy
morning-gown, wound loosely about at the waist with a cord and
tassel of scarlet silk; a bright-colored woollen shawl covered her
from the waist down, and a necklace of red coral heightened to its
utmost her untamable beauty.</p>

<a name="gs2188.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/gs2188.jpg"><img src=

<b>"Silently regarding the intruder with a pair of eyes that sent
an icy chill through him<br>
and fastened him where he stood, lay Palmyre Philosophe".</b></p>
<br>
<p>An instantaneous indignation against Doctor Keene set the face
of the speechless apothecary on fire, and this, being as
instantaneously comprehended by the philosophe, was the best of
introductions. Yet her gaze did not change.</p>
<p>The Congo negress broke the spell with a bristling protest, all
in African b's and k's, but hushed and drew off at a single word of
command from her mistress.</p>
<p>In Frowenfeld's mind an angry determination was taking shape, to
be neither trifled with nor contemned. And this again the quadroon
discerned, before he was himself aware of it.</p>
<p>"Doctor Keene"--he began, but stopped, so uncomfortable were her
eyes.</p>
<p>She did not stir or reply.</p>
<p>Then he bethought him with a start, and took off his dripping
hat.</p>
<p>At this a perceptible sparkle of imperious approval shot along
her glance; it gave the apothecary speech.</p>
<p>"The doctor is sick, and he asked me to dress your wound."</p>
<p>She made the slightest discernible motion of the head, remained
for a moment silent, and then, still with the same eye, motioned
her hand toward a chair near a comfortable fire.</p>
<p>He sat down. It would be well to dry himself. He drew near the
hearth and let his gaze fall into the fire. When he presently
lifted his eyes and looked full upon the woman with a steady,
candid glance, she was regarding him with apparent coldness, but
with secret diligence and scrutiny, and a yet more inward and
secret surprise and admiration. Hard rubbing was bringing out the
grain of the apothecary. But she presently suppressed the feeling.
She hated men.</p>
<p>But Frowenfeld, even while his eyes met hers, could not resent
her hostility. This monument of the shame of two races--this
poisonous blossom of crime growing out of crime--this final,
unanswerable white man's accuser--this would-be murderess--what
ranks and companies would have to stand up in the Great Day with
her and answer as accessory before the fact! He looked again into
the fire.</p>
<p>The patient spoke:</p>
<p>"<i>Eh bi'n, Mich&eacute;</i>?" Her look was severe, but less
aggressive. The shuffle of the old negress's feet was heard and she
appeared bearing warm and cold water and fresh bandages; after
depositing them she tarried.</p>
<p>"Your fever is gone," said Frowenfeld, standing by the bed. He
had laid his fingers on her wrist. She brushed them off and once
more turned full upon him the cold hostility of her passionate
eyes.</p>
<p>The apothecary, instead of blushing, turned pale.</p>
<p>"You--" he was going to say, "You insult me;" but his lips came
tightly together. Two big cords appeared between his brows, and his
blue eyes spoke for him. Then, as the returning blood rushed even
to his forehead, he said, speaking his words one by one;</p>
<p>"Please understand that you must trust me."</p>
<p>She may not have understood his English, but she comprehended,
nevertheless. She looked up fixedly for a moment, then passively
closed her eyes. Then she turned, and Frowenfeld put out one strong
arm, helped her to a sitting posture on the side of the bed and
drew the shawl about her.</p>
<p>"Zizi," she said, and the negress, who had stood perfectly still
since depositing the water and bandages, came forward and proceeded
to bare the philosophe's superb shoulder. As Frowenfeld again put
forward his hand, she lifted her own as if to prevent him, but he
kindly and firmly put it away and addressed himself with silent
diligence to his task; and by the time he had finished, his womanly
touch, his commanding gentleness, his easy despatch, had inspired
Palmyre not only with a sense of safety, comfort, and repose, but
with a pleased wonder.</p>
<p>This woman had stood all her life with dagger drawn, on the
defensive against what certainly was to her an unmerciful world.
With possibly one exception, the man now before her was the only
one she had ever encountered whose speech and gesture were clearly
keyed to that profound respect which is woman's first, foundation
claim on man. And yet, by inexorable decree, she belonged to what
we used to call "the happiest people under the sun." We ought to
stop saying that.</p>
<p>So far as Palmyre knew, the entire masculine wing of the mighty
and exalted race, three-fourths of whose blood bequeathed her none
of its prerogatives, regarded her as legitimate prey. The man
before her did not. There lay the fundamental difference that, in
her sight, as soon as she discovered it, glorified him. Before this
assurance the cold fierceness of her eyes gave way, and a
friendlier light from them rewarded the apothecary's final touch.
He called for more pillows, made a nest of them, and, as she let
herself softly into it, directed his next consideration toward his
hat and the door.</p>
<p>It was many an hour after he had backed out into the trivial
remains of the rain-storm before he could replace with more
tranquillizing images the vision of the philosophe reclining among
her pillows, in the act of making that uneasy movement of her
fingers upon the collar button of her robe, which women make when
they are uncertain about the perfection of their dishabille, and
giving her inaudible adieu with the majesty of an empress.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>FROWENFELD MAKES AN ARGUMENT</h3>
<br>
<p>On the afternoon of the same day on which Frowenfeld visited the
house of the philosophe, the weather, which had been so unfavorable
to his late plans, changed; the rain ceased, the wind drew around
to the south, and the barometer promised a clear sky. Wherefore he
decided to leave his business, when he should have made his evening
weather notes, to the care of M. Raoul Innerarity, and venture to
test both Mademoiselle Clotilde's repellent attitude and Aurora's
seeming cordiality at Number 19 rue Bienville.</p>
<p>Why he should go was a question which the apothecary felt
himself but partially prepared to answer. What necessity called
him, what good was to be effected, what was to happen next, were
points he would have liked to be clear upon. That he should be
going merely because he was invited to come--merely for the
pleasure of breathing their atmosphere--that he should be supinely
gravitating toward them--this conclusion he positively could not
allow; no, no; the love of books and the fear of women alike
protested.</p>
<p>True, they were a part of that book which is pronounced "the
proper study of mankind,"--indeed, that was probably the reason
which he sought: he was going to contemplate them as a frontispiece
to that unwriteable volume which he had undertaken to con. Also,
there was a charitable motive. Doctor Keene, months before, had
expressed a deep concern regarding their lack of protection and
even of daily provision; he must quietly look into that. Would some
unforeseen circumstance shut him off this evening again from this
very proper use of time and opportunity?</p>
<p>As he was sitting at the table in his back room, registering his
sunset observations, and wondering what would become of him if
Aurora should be out and that other in, he was startled by a loud,
deep voice exclaiming, close behind him:</p>
<p>"<i>Eh, bien! Monsieur le Professeur!</i>"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld knew by the tone, before he looked behind him, that
he would find M. Agricola Fusilier very red in the face; and when
he looked, the only qualification he could make was that the
citizen's countenance was not so ruddy as the red handkerchief in
which his arm was hanging.</p>
<p>"What have you there?" slowly continued the patriarch, taking
his free hand off his fettered arm and laying it upon the page as
Frowenfeld hurriedly rose, and endeavored to shut the book.</p>
<p>"Some private memoranda," answered the meteorologist, managing
to get one page turned backward, reddening with confusion and
indignation, and noticing that Agricola's spectacles were upside
down.</p>
<p>"Private! Eh? No such thing, sir! Professor Frowenfeld, allow
me" (a classic oath) "to say to your face, sir, that you are the
most brilliant and the most valuable man--of your years--in
afflicted Louisiana! Ha!" (reading:) "'Morning observation;
Cathedral clock, 7 A.M. Thermometer 70 degrees.' Ha! 'Hygrometer
l5'--but this is not to-day's weather? Ah! no. Ha! 'Barometer
30.380.' Ha! 'Sky cloudy, dark; wind, south, light.' Ha! 'River
rising.' Ha! Professor Frowenfeld, when will you give your splendid
services to your section? You must tell me, my son, for I ask you,
my son, not from curiosity, but out of impatient interest."</p>
<p>"I cannot say that I shall ever publish my tables," replied the
"son," pulling at the book.</p>
<p>"Then, sir, in the name of Louisiana," thundered the old man,
clinging to the book, "I can! They shall be published! Ah! yes,
dear Frowenfeld. The book, of course, will be in French, eh? You
would not so affront the most sacred prejudices of the noble people
to whom you owe everything as to publish it in English? You--ah!
have we torn it?"</p>
<p>"I do not write French," said the apothecary, laying the torn
edges together.</p>
<p>"Professor Frowenfeld, men are born for each other. What do I
behold before me? I behold before me, in the person of my gifted
young friend, a supplement to myself! Why has Nature strengthened
the soul of Agricola to hold the crumbling fortress of this body
until these eyes--which were once, my dear boy, as proud and
piercing as the battle-steed's--have become dim?"</p>
<p>Joseph's insurmountable respect for gray hairs kept him
standing, but he did not respond with any conjecture as to Nature's
intentions, and there was a stern silence.</p>
<p>The crumbling fortress resumed, his voice pitched low like the
beginning of the long roll. He knew Nature's design.</p>
<p>"It was in order that you, Professor Frowenfeld, might become my
vicar! Your book shall be in French! We must give it a wide scope!
It shall contain valuable geographical, topographical,
biographical, and historical notes. It shall contain complete lists
of all the officials in the province (I don't say territory, I say
province) with their salaries and perquisites; ah! we will expose
that! And--ha! I will write some political essays for it. Raoul
shall illustrate it. Honor&eacute; shall give you money to publish
it. Ah! Professor Frowenfeld, the star of your fame is rising out
of the waves of oblivion! Come--I dropped in purposely to ask
you--come across the street and take a glass of <i>taffia</i> with
Agricola Fusilier."</p>
<p>This crowning honor the apothecary was insane enough to decline,
and Agricola went away with many professions of endearment, but
secretly offended because Joseph had not asked about his wound.</p>
<p>All the same the apothecary, without loss of time, departed for
the yellow-washed cottage, Number 19 rue Bienville.</p>
<p>"To-morrow, at four P.M.," he said to himself, "if the weather
is favorable, I ride with M. Grandissime."</p>
<p>He almost saw his books and instruments look up at him
reproachfully.</p>
<p>The ladies were at home. Aurora herself opened the door, and
Clotilde came forward from the bright fireplace with a cordiality
never before so unqualified. There was something about these
ladies--in their simple, but noble grace, in their half-Gallic,
half-classic beauty, in a jocund buoyancy mated to an amiable
dignity--that made them appear to the scholar as though they had
just bounded into life from the garlanded procession of some old
fresco. The resemblance was not a little helped on by the costume
of the late Revolution (most acceptably chastened and belated by
the distance from Paris). Their black hair, somewhat heavier on
Clotilde's head, where it rippled once or twice, was knotted <i>en
Grecque</i>, and adorned only with the spoils of a nosegay given to
Clotilde by a chivalric small boy in the home of her music
scholar.</p>
<p>"We was expectin' you since several days," said Clotilde, as the
three sat down before the fire, Frowenfeld in a cushioned chair
whose moth-holes had been carefully darned.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld intimated, with tolerable composure, that matters
beyond his control had delayed his coming, beyond his
intention.</p>
<p>"You gedd'n' ridge," said Aurora, dropping her wrists across
each other.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld, for once, laughed outright, and it seemed so odd in
him to do so that both the ladies followed his example. The
ambition to be rich had never entered his thought, although in an
unemotional, German way, he was prospering in a little city where
wealth was daily pouring in, and a man had only to keep step, so to
say, to march into possessions.</p>
<p>"You hought to 'ave a mo' larger sto' an' some clerque," pursued
Aurora.</p>
<p>The apothecary answered that he was contemplating the
enlargement of his present place or removal to a roomier, and that
he had already employed an assistant.</p>
<p>"Oo it is, 'Sieur Frowenfel'?"</p>
<p>Clotilde turned toward the questioner a remonstrative
glance.</p>
<p>"His name," replied Frowenfeld, betraying a slight
embarrassment, "is--Innerarity; Mr. Raoul Innerarity; he is--"</p>
<p>"Ee pain' dad pigtu' w'at 'angin' in yo' window?"</p>
<p>Clotilde's remonstrance rose to a slight movement and a
murmur.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld answered in the affirmative, and possibly betrayed
the faint shadow of a smile. The response was a peal of laughter
from both ladies.</p>
<br>

<b>"On their part, they would sit in deep attention, shielding
their faces from the fire, and responding to enunciations directly
contrary to their convictions with an occasional 'yes-seh,' or
'ceddenly,' or 'of coze,' or,--prettier affirmation still,--a
solemn drooping of the eyelids".</b></p>
<br>
<p>"He is an excellent drug clerk," said Frowenfeld
defensively.</p>
<p>Whereat Aurora laughed again, leaning over and touching
Clotilde's knee with one finger.</p>
<p>"An' excellen' drug cl'--ha, ha, ha! oh!"</p>
<p>"You muz podden uz, M'sieu' Frowenfel'," said Clotilde, with
forced gravity.</p>
<p>Aurora sighed her participation in the apology; and, a few
moments later, the apothecary and both ladies (the one as fond of
the abstract as the other two were ignorant of the concrete) were
engaged in an animated, running discussion on art, society,
climate, education,--all those large, secondary <i>desiderata</i>
which seem of first importance to young ambition and secluded
beauty, flying to and fro among these subjects with all the
liveliness and uncertainty of a game of pussy-wants-a-corner.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld had never before spent such an hour. At its
expiration, he had so well held his own against both the others,
that the three had settled down to this sort of entertainment:
Aurora would make an assertion, or Clotilde would ask a question;
and Frowenfeld, moved by that frankness and ardent zeal for truth
which had enlisted the early friendship of Dr. Keene, amused and
attracted Honor&eacute; Grandissime, won the confidence of the
f.m.c., and tamed the fiery distrust and enmity of Palmyre, would
present his opinions without the thought of a reservation either in
himself or his hearers. On their part, they would sit in deep
attention, shielding their faces from the fire, and responding to
enunciations directly contrary to their convictions with an
occasional "yes-seh," or "ceddenly," or "of coze," or,--prettier
affirmation still,--a solemn drooping of the eyelids, a slight
compression of the lips, and a low, slow declination of the
head.</p>
<p>"The bane of all Creole art-effort"--(we take up the
apothecary's words at a point where Clotilde was leaning forward
and slightly frowning in an honest attempt to comprehend his
condensed English)--"the bane of all Creole art-effort, so far as I
have seen it, is amateurism."</p>
<p>"Amateu--" murmured Clotilde, a little beclouded on the main
word and distracted by a French difference of meaning, but planting
an elbow on one knee in the genuineness of her attention, and
responding with a bow.</p>
<p>"That is to say," said Frowenfeld, apologizing for the
homeliness of his further explanation by a smile, "a kind of
ambitious indolence that lays very large eggs, but can neither see
the necessity for building a nest beforehand, nor command the
patience to hatch the eggs afterward."</p>
<p>"Of coze," said Aurora.</p>
<p>"It is a great pity," said the sermonizer, looking at the face
of Clotilde, elongated in the brass andiron; and, after a pause:
"Nothing on earth can take the place of hard and patient labor. But
that, in this community, is not esteemed; most sorts of it are
contemned; the humbler sorts are despised, and the higher are
regarded with mingled patronage and commiseration. Most of those
who come to my shop with their efforts at art hasten to explain,
either that they are merely seeking pastime, or else that they are
driven to their course by want; and if I advise them to take their
work back and finish it, they take it back and never return.
Industry is not only despised, but has been degraded and disgraced,
handed over into the hands of African savages."</p>
<p>"Doze Creole' is <i>lezzy</i>," said Aurora.</p>
<p>"That is a hard word to apply to those who do not
<i>consciously</i> deserve it," said Frowenfeld; "but if they could
only wake up to the fact,--find it out themselves--"</p>
<p>"Ceddenly," said Clotilde.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'," said Aurora, leaning her head on one side,
"some pipple thing it is doze climade; 'ow you lag doze
climade?"</p>
<p>"I do not suppose," replied the visitor, "there is a more
delightful climate in the world."</p>
<p>"Ah-h-h!"--both ladies at once, in a low, gracious tone of
acknowledgment.</p>
<p>"I thing Louisiana is a paradize-me!" said Aurora. "W'ere you
goin' fin' sudge a h-air?" She respired a sample of it. "W'ere you
goin' fin' sudge a so ridge groun'? De weed' in my bag yard is
twenny-five feet 'igh!"</p>
<p>"Ah! maman!"</p>
<p>"Twenty-six!" said Aurora, correcting herself. "W'ere you fin'
sudge a reever lag dad Mississippi? <i>On dit</i>," she said,
turning to Clotilde, "<i>que ses eaux ont la
propri&eacute;t&eacute; de contribuer m&ecirc;me &agrave;
multiplier l'esp&egrave;ce humaine</i>--ha, ha, ha!"</p>
<p>Clotilde turned away an unmoved countenance to hear
Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld had contracted a habit of falling into meditation
whenever the French language left him out of the conversation.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, breaking a contemplative pause, "the climate is
<i>too</i> comfortable and the soil too rich,--though I do not
think it is entirely on their account that the people who enjoy
them are so sadly in arrears to the civilized world." He blushed
with the fear that his talk was bookish, and felt grateful to
Clotilde for seeming to understand his speech.</p>
<p>"W'ad you fin' de rizzon is, 'Sieur Frowenfel'?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I do not wish to philosophize," he answered.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais</i>, go hon." "<i>Mais</i>, go ahade," said both
ladies, settling themselves.</p>
<p>"It is largely owing," exclaimed Frowenfeld, with sudden fervor,
"to a defective organization of society, which keeps this
community, and will continue to keep it for an indefinite time to
come, entirely unprepared and disinclined to follow the course of
modern thought."</p>
<p>"Of coze," murmured Aurora, who had lost her bearings almost at
the first word.</p>
<p>"One great general subject of thought now is human
rights,--universal human rights. The entire literature of the world
is becoming tinctured with contradictions of the dogmas upon which
society in this section is built. Human rights is, of all subjects,
the one upon which this community is most violently determined to
hear no discussion. It has pronounced that slavery and caste are
right, and sealed up the whole subject. What, then, will they do
with the world's literature? They will coldly decline to look at
it, and will become, more and more as the world moves on, a
comparatively illiterate people."</p>
<p>"Bud, 'Sieur Frowenfel'," said Clotilde, as Frowenfeld
paused--Aurora was stunned to silence,--"de Unitee State' goin' pud
doze nigga' free, aind it?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld pushed his hair hard back. He was in the stream now,
and might as well go through.</p>
<p>"I have heard that charge made, even by some Americans. I do not
know. But there is a slavery that no legislation can abolish,--the
slavery of caste. That, like all the slaveries on earth, is a
double bondage. And what a bondage it is which compels a community,
in order to preserve its established tyrannies, to walk behind the
rest of the intelligent world! What a bondage is that which incites
a people to adopt a system of social and civil distinctions,
possessing all the enormities and none of the advantages of those
systems which Europe is learning to despise! This system, moreover,
is only kept up by a flourish of weapons. We have here what you may
call an armed aristocracy. The class over which these instruments
of main force are held is chosen for its servility, ignorance, and
cowardice; hence, indolence in the ruling class. When a man's
social or civil standing is not dependent on his knowing how to
read, he is not likely to become a scholar."</p>
<p>"Of coze," said Aurora, with a pensive respiration, "I thing id
is doze climade," and the apothecary stopped, as a man should who
finds himself unloading large philosophy in a little parlor.</p>
<p>"I thing, me, dey hought to pud doze quadroon' free?" It was
Clotilde who spoke, ending with the rising inflection to indicate
the tentative character of this daringly premature declaration.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld did not answer hastily.</p>
<p>"The quadroons," said he, "want a great deal more than mere free
papers can secure them. Emancipation before the law, though it may
be a right which man has no right to withhold, is to them little
more than a mockery until they achieve emancipation in the minds
and good will of the people--'the people,' did I say? I mean the
ruling class." He stopped again. One must inevitably feel a little
silly, setting up tenpins for ladies who are too polite, even if
able, to bowl them down.</p>
<p>Aurora and the visitor began to speak simultaneously; both
apologized, and Aurora said:</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', w'en I was a lill girl,"--and Frowenfeld
knew that he was going to hear the story of Palmyre. Clotilde
moved, with the obvious intention to mend the fire. Aurora asked,
in French, why she did not call the cook to do it, and Frowenfeld
said, "Let me,"--threw on some wood, and took a seat nearer
Clotilde. Aurora had the floor.</p>

<h3>AURORA AS A HISTORIAN</h3>
<br>
<p>Alas! the phonograph was invented three-quarters of a century
too late. If type could entrap one-half the pretty oddities of
Aurora's speech,--the arch, the pathetic, the grave, the earnest,
the matter-of-fact, the ecstatic tones of her voice,--nay, could it
but reproduce the movement of her hands, the eloquence of her eyes,
or the shapings of her mouth,--ah! but type--even the
phonograph--is such an inadequate thing! Sometimes she laughed;
sometimes Clotilde, unexpectedly to herself, joined her; and twice
or thrice she provoked a similar demonstration from the ox-like
apothecary,--to her own intense amusement. Sometimes she shook her
head in solemn scorn; and, when Frowenfeld, at a certain point
where Palmyre's fate locked hands for a time with that of
Bras-Coup&eacute;, asked a fervid question concerning that strange
personage, tears leaped into her eyes, as she said:</p>
<p>"Ah! 'Sieur Frowenfel', iv I tra to tell de sto'y of
Bras-Coup&eacute;, I goin' to cry lag a lill bebby."</p>
<p>The account of the childhood days upon the plantation at Cannes
Brul&eacute;es may be passed by. It was early in Palmyre's
fifteenth year that that Kentuckian, 'mutual friend' of her master
and Agricola, prevailed with M. de Grapion to send her to the
paternal Grandissime mansion,--a complimentary gift, through
Agricola, to Mademoiselle, his niece,--returnable ten years after
date.</p>
<p>The journey was made in safety; and, by and by, Palmyre was
presented to her new mistress. The occasion was notable. In a great
chair in the centre sat the <i>grandp&egrave;re</i>, a Chevalier de
Grandissime, whose business had narrowed down to sitting on the
front veranda and wearing his decorations,--the cross of St. Louis
being one; on his right, Colonel Numa Grandissime, with one arm
dropped around Honor&eacute;, then a boy of Palmyre's age,
expecting to be off in sixty days for France; and on the left, with
Honor&eacute;'s fair sister nestled against her, "Madame Numa," as
the Creoles would call her, a stately woman and beautiful, a great
admirer of her brother Agricola. (Aurora took pains to explain that
she received these minutiae from Palmyre herself in later years.)
One other member of the group was a young don of some twenty years'
age, not an inmate of the house, but only a cousin of Aurora on her
deceased mother's side. To make the affair complete, and as a seal
to this tacit Grandissime-de-Grapion treaty, this sole available
representative of the "other side" was made a guest for the
evening. Like the true Spaniard that he was, Don Jos&eacute;
Martinez fell deeply in love with Honor&eacute;'s sister. Then
there came Agricola leading in Palmyre. There were others, for the
Grandissime mansion was always full of Grandissimes; but this was
the central group.</p>
<p>In this house Palmyre grew to womanhood, retaining without
interruption the place into which she seemed to enter by right of
indisputable superiority over all competitors,--the place of
favorite attendant to the sister of Honor&eacute;. Attendant, we
say, for servant she never seemed. She grew tall, arrowy, lithe,
imperial, diligent, neat, thorough, silent. Her new mistress,
though scarcely at all her senior, was yet distinctly her mistress;
she had that through her Fusilier blood; experience was just then
beginning to show that the Fusilier Grandissime was a superb
variety; she was a mistress one could wish to obey. Palmyre loved
her, and through her contact ceased, for a time, at least, to be
the pet leopard she had been at the Cannes Brul&eacute;es.</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; went away to Paris only sixty days after Palmyre
entered the house. But even that was not soon enough.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'," said Aurora, in her recital, "Palmyre, she
never tole me dad, <i>mais</i> I am shoe, <i>shoe</i> dad she fall
in love wid Honor&eacute; Grandissime. 'Sieur Frowenfel', I thing
dad Honor&eacute; Grandissime is one bad man, ent it? Whad you
thing, 'Sieur Frowenfel'?"</p>
<p>"I think, as I said to you the last time, that he is one of the
best, as I know that he is one of the kindest and most enlightened
gentlemen in the city," said the apothecary.</p>
<p>"Ah, 'Sieur Frowenfel'! ha, ha!"</p>
<p>"That is my conviction."</p>
<p>The lady went on with her story.</p>
<p>"Hanny'ow, I know she <i>con</i>tinue in love wid 'im all doze
ten year' w'at 'e been gone. She baig Mademoiselle Grandissime to
wrad dad ledder to my papa to ass to kip her two years mo'."</p>
<p>Here Aurora carefully omitted that episode which Doctor Keene
had related to Frowenfeld,--her own marriage and removal to Fausse
Rivi&egrave;re, the visit of her husband to the city, his
unfortunate and finally fatal affair with Agricola, and the
surrender of all her land and slaves to that successful
duellist.</p>
<p>M. de Grapion, through all that, stood by his engagement
concerning Palmyre; and, at the end of ten years, to his own
astonishment, responded favorably to a letter from Honor&eacute;'s
sister, irresistible for its goodness, good sense, and eloquent
pleading, asking leave to detain Palmyre two years longer; but this
response came only after the old master and his pretty, stricken
Aurora had wept over it until they were weak and gentle,--and was
not a response either, but only a silent consent.</p>
<p>Shortly before the return of Honor&eacute;--and here it was that
Aurora took up again the thread of her account--while his mother,
long-widowed, reigned in the paternal mansion, with Agricola for
her manager, Bras-Coup&eacute; appeared. From that advent, and the
long and varied mental sufferings which its consequences brought
upon her, sprang that second change in Palmyre, which made her
finally untamable, and ended in a manumission, granted her more for
fear than for conscience' sake. When Aurora attempted to tell those
experiences, even leaving Bras-Coup&eacute; as much as might be out
of the recital, she choked with tears at the very start, stopped,
laughed, and said:</p>
<p>"<i>C'est tout</i>--daz all. 'Sieur Frowenfel', oo you fine dad
pigtu' to loog lag, yonnah, hon de wall?"</p>
<p>She spoke as if he might have overlooked it, though twenty
times, at least, in the last hour, she had seen him glance at
it.</p>
<p>"It is a good likeness," said the apothecary, turning to
Clotilde, yet showing himself somewhat puzzled in the matter of the
costume.</p>
<p>The ladies laughed.</p>

<p>"Dass one <i>fille &agrave; la cassette</i>," said Aurora, "my
gran'-muzzah; <i>mais</i>, ad de sem tarn id is Clotilde." She
touched her daughter under the chin with a ringed finger. "Clotilde
is my gran'-mamma."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld rose to go.</p>
<p>"You muz come again, 'Sieur Frowenfel'," said both ladies, in a
breath.</p>
<p>What could he say?</p>

<h3>A RIDE AND A RESCUE</h3>
<br>
<p>"Douane or Bienville?"</p>
<p>Such was the choice presented by Honor&eacute; Grandissime to
Joseph Frowenfeld, as the former on a lively brown colt and the
apothecary on a nervy chestnut fell into a gentle, preliminary trot
while yet in the rue Royale, looked after by that great admirer of
both, Raoul Innerarity.</p>
<p>"Douane?" said Frowenfeld. (It was the street we call
Custom-house.)</p>
<p>"It has mud-holes," objected Honor&eacute;.</p>
<p>"Well, then, the rue du Canal?"</p>
<p>"The canal--I can smell it from here. Why not rue
Bienville?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld said he did not know. (We give the statement for what
it is worth.)</p>
<p>Notice their route. A spirit of perversity seems to have entered
into the very topography of this quarter. They turned up the rue
Bienville (up is toward the river); reaching the levee, they took
their course up the shore of the Mississippi (almost due south),
and broke into a lively gallop on the Tchoupitoulas road, which in
those days skirted that margin of the river nearest the sunsetting,
namely, the <i>eastern</i> bank.</p>
<p>Conversation moved sluggishly for a time, halting upon trite
topics or swinging easily from polite inquiry to mild affirmation,
and back again. They were men of thought, these two, and one of
them did not fully understand why he was in his present position;
hence some reticence. It was one of those afternoons in early March
that make one wonder how the rest of the world avoids emigrating to
Louisiana in a body.</p>
<p>"Is not the season early?" asked Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime believed it was; but then the Creole spring
always seemed so, he said.</p>
<p>The land was an inverted firmament of flowers. The birds were an
innumerable, busy, joy-compelling multitude, darting and fluttering
hither and thither, as one might imagine the babes do in heaven.
The orange-groves were in blossom; their dark-green boughs seemed
snowed upon from a cloud of incense, and a listening ear might
catch an incessant, whispered trickle of falling petals, dropping
"as the honey-comb." The magnolia was beginning to add to its dark
and shining evergreen foliage frequent sprays of pale new leaves
and long, slender, buff buds of others yet to come. The oaks, both
the bare-armed and the "green-robed senators," the willows, and the
plaqueminiers, were putting out their subdued florescence as if
they smiled in grave participation with the laughing gardens. The
homes that gave perfection to this beauty were those old, large,
belvidered colonial villas, of which you may still here and there
see one standing, battered into half ruin, high and broad, among
foundries, cotton-and tobacco-sheds, junk-yards, and longshoremen's
hovels, like one unconquered elephant in a wreck of artillery. In
Frowenfeld's day the "smell of their garments was like Lebanon."
They were seen by glimpses through chance openings in lofty hedges
of Cherokee-rose or bois-d'arc, under boughs of cedar or
pride-of-China, above their groves of orange or down their long,
overarched avenues of oleander; and the lemon and the pomegranate,
the banana, the fig, the shaddock, and at times even the mango and
the guava, joined "hands around" and tossed their fragrant locks
above the lilies and roses. Frowenfeld forgot to ask himself
further concerning the probable intent of M. Grandissime's
invitation to ride; these beauties seemed rich enough in good
reasons. He felt glad and grateful.</p>
<p>At a certain point the two horses turned of their own impulse,
as by force of habit, and with a few clambering strides mounted to
the top of the levee and stood still, facing the broad, dancing,
hurrying, brimming river.</p>
<p>The Creole stole an amused glance at the elated, self-forgetful
look of his immigrant friend.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld," he said, as the delighted apothecary turned
with unwonted suddenness and saw his smile, "I believe you like
this better than discussion. You find it easier to be in harmony
with Louisiana than with Louisianians, eh?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld colored with surprise. Something unpleasant had
lately occurred in his shop. Was this to signify that M.
Grandissime had heard of it?</p>
<p>"I am a Louisianian," replied he, as if this were a point
assailed.</p>
<p>"I would not insinuate otherwise," said M. Grandissime, with a
kindly gesture. "I would like you to feel so. We are citizens now
of a different government from that under which we lived the
morning we first met. Yet"--the Creole paused and smiled--"you are
not, and I am glad you are not, what we call a Louisianian."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's color increased. He turned quickly in his saddle as
if to say something very positive, but hesitated, restrained
himself and asked:</p>
<p>"Mr. Grandissime, is not your Creole 'we' a word that does much
damage?"</p>
<p>The Creole's response was at first only a smile, followed by a
thoughtful countenance; but he presently said, with some
suddenness:</p>
<p>"My-de'-seh, yes. Yet you see I am, even this moment, forgetting
we are not a separate people. Yes, our Creole 'we' does damage, and
our Creole 'you' does more. I assure you, sir, I try hard to get my
people to understand that it is time to stop calling those who come
and add themselves to the community, aliens, interlopers, invaders.
That is what I hear my cousins, 'Polyte and Sylvestre, in the heat
of discussion, called you the other evening; is it so?"</p>
<p>"I brought it upon myself," said Frowenfeld. "I brought it upon
myself."</p>
<p>"Ah!" interrupted M. Grandissime, with a broad smile, "excuse
me--I am fully prepared to believe it. But the charge is a false
one. I told them so. My-de'-seh--I know that a citizen of the
United States in the United States has a right to become, and to be
called, under the laws governing the case, a Louisianian, a
Vermonter, or a Virginian, as it may suit his whim; and even if he
should be found dishonest or dangerous, he has a right to be
treated just exactly as we treat the knaves and ruffians who are
native born! Every discreet man must admit that."</p>
<p>"But if they do not enforce it, Mr. Grandissime," quickly
responded the sore apothecary, "if they continually forget it--if
one must surrender himself to the errors and crimes of the
community as he finds it--"</p>
<p>The Creole uttered a low laugh.</p>
<p>"Party differences, Mr. Frowenfeld; they have them in all
countries."</p>
<p>"So your cousins said," said Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"And how did you answer them?"</p>
<p>"Offensively," said the apothecary, with sincere
mortification.</p>
<p>"Oh! that was easy," replied the other, amusedly; "but how?"</p>
<p>"I said that, having here only such party differences as are
common elsewhere, we do not behave as they elsewhere do; that in
most civilized countries the immigrant is welcome, but here he is
not. I am afraid I have not learned the art of courteous debate,"
said Frowenfeld, with a smile of apology.</p>
<p>"'Tis a great art," said the Creole, quietly, stroking his
horse's neck. "I suppose my cousins denied your statement with
indignation, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes; they said the honest immigrant is always welcome."</p>
<p>"Well, do you not find that true?"</p>
<p>"But, Mr. Grandissime, that is requiring the immigrant to prove
his innocence!" Frowenfeld spoke from the heart. "And even the
honest immigrant is welcome only when he leaves his peculiar
opinions behind him. Is that right, sir?"</p>
<p>The Creole smiled at Frowenfeld's heat.</p>
<p>"My-de'-seh, my cousins complain that you advocate measures
fatal to the prevailing order of society."</p>
<p>"But," replied the unyielding Frowenfeld, turning redder than
ever, "that is the very thing that American liberty gives me the
right--peaceably--to do! Here is a structure of society defective,
dangerous, erected on views of human relations which the world is
abandoning as false; yet the immigrant's welcome is modified with
the warning not to touch these false foundations with one of his
fingers."</p>
<p>"Did you tell my cousins the foundations of society here are
false?"</p>
<p>"I regret to say I did, very abruptly. I told them they were
privately aware of the fact."</p>
<p>"You may say," said the ever-amiable Creole, "that you allowed
debate to run into controversy, eh?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld was silent; he compared the gentleness of this
Creole's rebukes with the asperity of his advocacy of right, and
felt humiliated. But M. Grandissime spoke with a rallying
smile.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld, you never make pills with eight corners
eh?"</p>
<p>"No, sir." The apothecary smiled.</p>
<p>"No, you make them round; cannot you make your doctrines the
same way? My-de'-seh, you will think me impertinent; but the reason
I speak is because I wish very much that you and my cousins would
not be offended with each other. To tell you the truth, my-de'-seh,
I hoped to use you with them--pardon my frankness."</p>
<p>"If Louisiana had more men like you, M. Grandissime," cried the
untrained Frowenfeld, "society would be less sore to the
touch."</p>
<p>"My-de'-seh," said the Creole, laying his hand out toward his
companion and turning his horse in such a way as to turn the other
also, "do me one favor; remember that it <i>is</i> sore to the
touch."</p>
<p>The animals picked their steps down the inner face of the levee
and resumed their course up the road at a walk.</p>
<p>"Did you see that man just turn the bend of the road, away
yonder?" the Creole asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did you recognize him?"</p>
<p>"It was--my landlord, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Did he not have a conversation with you lately, too?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"It has had a bad effect on him. I wonder why he is out here on
foot?"</p>
<p>The horses quickened their paces. The two friends rode along in
silence. Frowenfeld noticed his companion frequently cast an eye up
along the distant sunset shadows of the road with a new anxiety.
Yet, when M. Grandissime broke the silence it was only to say:</p>
<p>"I suppose you find the blemishes in our state of society can
all be attributed to one main defect, Mr. Frowenfeld?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld was glad of the chance to answer:</p>
<p>"I have not overlooked that this society has disadvantages as
well as blemishes; it is distant from enlightened centres; it has a
language and religion different from that of the great people of
which it is now called to be a part. That it has also positive
blemishes of organism--"</p>
<p>"Yes," interrupted the Creole, smiling at the immigrant's sudden
magnanimity, "its positive blemishes; do they all spring from one
main defect?"</p>
<p>"I think not. The climate has its influence, the soil has its
influence--dwellers in swamps cannot be mountaineers."</p>
<p>"But after all," persisted the Creole, "the greater part of our
troubles comes from--"</p>
<p>"Slavery," said Frowenfeld, "or rather caste."</p>
<p>"Exactly," said M. Grandissime.</p>
<p>"You surprise me, sir," said the simple apothecary. "I supposed
you were--"</p>
<p>"My-de'-seh," exclaimed M. Grandissime, suddenly becoming very
earnest, "I am nothing, nothing! There is where you have the
advantage of me. I am but a <i>dilettante</i>, whether in politics,
in philosophy, morals, or religion. I am afraid to go deeply into
anything, lest it should make ruin in my name, my family, my
property."</p>
<p>He laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>The question darted into Frowenfeld's mind, whether this might
not be a hint of the matter that M. Grandissime had been trying to
see him about.</p>
<p>"Mr. Grandissime," he said, "I can hardly believe you would
neglect a duty either for family, property, or society."</p>
<p>"Well, you mistake," said the Creole, so coldly that Frowenfeld
colored.</p>
<p>They galloped on. M. Grandissime brightened again, almost to the
degree of vivacity. By and by they slackened to a slow trot and
were silent. The gardens had been long left behind, and they were
passing between continuous Cherokee-rose hedges on the right and on
the left, along that bend of the Mississippi where its waters,
glancing off three miles above from the old De Macarty levee (now
Carrollton), at the slightest opposition in the breeze go whirling
and leaping like a herd of dervishes across to the ever-crumbling
shore, now marked by the little yellow depot-house of Westwego.
Miles up the broad flood the sun was disappearing gorgeously. From
their saddles, the two horsemen feasted on the scene without
comment.</p>
<p>But presently, M. Grandissime uttered a low ejaculation and
spurred his horse toward a tree hard by, preparing, as he went, to
fasten his rein to an overhanging branch. Frowenfeld, agreeable to
his beckon, imitated the movement.</p>
<p>"I fear he intends to drown himself," whispered M. Grandissime,
as they hurriedly dismounted.</p>
<p>"Who? Not--"</p>
<p>"Yes, your landlord, as you call him. He is on the flatboat; I
saw his hat over the levee. When we get on top the levee, we must
get right into it. But do not follow him into the water in front of
the flat; it is certain death; no power of man could keep you from
going under it."</p>
<p>The words were quickly spoken; they scrambled to the levee's
crown. Just abreast of them lay a flatboat, emptied of its cargo
and moored to the levee. They leaped into it. A human figure
swerved from the onset of the Creole and ran toward the bow of the
boat, and in an instant more would have been in the river.</p>
<p>"Stop!" said Frowenfeld, seizing the unresisting f.m.c. firmly
by the collar.</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; Grandissime smiled, partly at the apothecary's
brief speech, but much more at his success.</p>
<p>"Let him go, Mr. Frowenfeld," he said, as he came near.</p>
<p>The silent man turned away his face with a gesture of shame.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime, in a gentle voice, exchanged a few words with
him, and he turned and walked away, gained the shore, descended the
levee, and took a foot-path which soon hid him behind a hedge.</p>
<p>"He gives his pledge not to try again," said the Creole, as the
two companions proceeded to resume the saddle. "Do not look after
him." (Joseph had cast a searching look over the hedge.)</p>
<p>They turned homeward.</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Frowenfeld," said the Creole, suddenly, "if the
<i>immygrant</i> has cause of complaint, how much more has
<i>that</i> man! True, it is only love for which he would have just
now drowned himself; yet what an accusation, my-de'-seh, is his
whole life against that 'caste' which shuts him up within its
narrow and almost solitary limits! And yet, Mr. Frowenfeld, this
people esteem this very same crime of caste the holiest and most
precious of their virtues. My-de'-seh, it never occurs to us that
in this matter we are interested, and therefore disqualified,
witnesses. We say we are not understood; that the jury (the
civilized world) renders its decision without viewing the body;
that we are judged from a distance. We forget that we ourselves are
too <i>close</i> to see distinctly, and so continue, a spectacle to
civilization, sitting in a horrible darkness, my-de'-seh!" He
frowned.</p>
<p>"The shadow of the Ethiopian," said the grave apothecary.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime's quick gesture implied that Frowenfeld had said
the very word.</p>
<p>"Ah! my-de'-seh, when I try sometimes to stand outside and look
at it, I am <i>ama-aze</i> at the length, the blackness of that
shadow!" (He was so deeply in earnest that he took no care of his
English.) "It is the <i>N&eacute;m&eacute;sis</i> w'ich, instead of
coming afteh, glides along by the side of this morhal, political,
commercial, social mistake! It blanches, my-de'-seh, ow whole
civilization! It drhags us a centurhy behind the rhes' of the
world! It rhetahds and poisons everhy industrhy we got!--mos' of
all our-h immense agrhicultu'e! It brheeds a thousan' cusses that
nevva leave home but jus' flutter-h up an' rhoost, my-de'-seh, on
ow <i>heads</i>; an' we nevva know it!--yes, sometimes some of us
know it."</p>
<p>He changed the subject.</p>
<p>They had repassed the ruins of Fort St. Louis, and were well
within the precincts of the little city, when, as they pulled up
from a final gallop, mention was made of Doctor Keene. He was
improving; Honor&eacute; had seen him that morning; so, at another
hour, had Frowenfeld. Doctor Keene had told Honor&eacute; about
Palmyre's wound.</p>
<p>"You was at her house again this morning?" asked the Creole.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime shook his head warningly.</p>
<p>"'Tis a dangerous business. You are almost sure to become the
object of slander. You ought to tell Doctor Keene to make some
other arrangement, or presently you, too, will be under the--" he
lowered his voice, for Frowenfeld was dismounting at the shop door,
and three or four acquaintances stood around--"under the 'shadow of
the Ethiopian.'"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE F&Ecirc;TE DE GRANDP&Egrave;RE</h3>
<br>
<p>Sojourners in New Orleans who take their afternoon drive down
Esplanade street will notice, across on the right, between it and
that sorry streak once fondly known as Champs
&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, two or three large, old houses, rising above
the general surroundings and displaying architectural features
which identify them with an irrevocable past--a past when the
faithful and true Creole could, without fear of contradiction,
express his religious belief that the antipathy he felt for the
Am&eacute;ricain invader was an inborn horror laid lengthwise in
his ante-natal bones by a discriminating and appreciative
Providence. There is, for instance, or was until lately, one house
which some hundred and fifteen years ago was the suburban residence
of the old sea-captain governor, Kerlerec. It stands up among the
oranges as silent and gray as a pelican, and, so far as we know,
has never had one cypress plank added or subtracted since its
master was called to France and thrown into the Bastile. Another
has two dormer windows looking out westward, and, when the setting
sun strikes the panes, reminds one of a man with spectacles
standing up in an audience, searching for a friend who is not there
and will never come back. These houses are the last remaining--if,
indeed, they were not pulled down yesterday--of a group that once
marked from afar the direction of the old highway between the
city's walls and the suburb St. Jean. Here clustered the earlier
aristocracy of the colony; all that pretty crew of counts,
chevaliers, marquises, colonels, dons, etc., who loved their kings,
and especially their kings' moneys, with an <i>abandon</i> which
affected the accuracy of nearly all their accounts.</p>
<p>Among these stood the great mother-mansion of the Grandissimes.
Do not look for it now; it is quite gone. The round,
white-plastered brick pillars which held the house fifteen feet up
from the reeking ground and rose on loftily to sustain the great
overspreading roof, or clustered in the cool, paved basement; the
lofty halls, with their multitudinous glitter of gilded brass and
twinkle of sweet-smelling wax-candles; the immense encircling
veranda, where twenty Creole girls might walk abreast; the great
front stairs, descending from the veranda to the garden, with a
lofty palm on either side, on whose broad steps forty Grandissimes
could gather on a birthday afternoon; and the belvidere, whence you
could see the cathedral, the Ursulines', the governor's mansion,
and the river, far away, shining between the villas of
Tchoupitoulas Coast--all have disappeared as entirely beyond recall
as the flowers that bloomed in the gardens on the day of this
<i>f&ecirc;te de grandp&egrave;re</i>.</p>
<p>Odd to say, it was not the grandp&egrave;re's birthday that had
passed. For weeks the happy children of the many Grandissime
branches--the Mandarins, the St. Blancards, the Brahmins--had been
standing with their uplifted arms apart, awaiting the signal to
clap hands and jump, and still, from week to week, the appointed
day had been made to fall back, and fall back before--what think
you?--an inability to understand Honor&eacute;.</p>
<p>It was a sad paradox in the history of this majestic old house
that her best child gave her the most annoyance; but it had long
been so. Even in Honor&eacute;'s early youth, a scant two years
after she had watched him, over the tops of her green myrtles and
white and crimson oleanders, go away, a lad of fifteen, supposing
he would of course come back a Grandissime of the Grandissimes--an
inflexible of the inflexibles--he was found "inciting" (so the
stately dames and officials who graced her front veranda called it)
a Grandissime-De Grapion reconciliation by means of transatlantic
letters, and reducing the flames of the old feud, rekindled by the
Fusilier-Nancanou duel, to a little foul smoke. The main difficulty
seemed to be that Honor&eacute; could not be satisfied with a clean
conscience as to his own deeds and the peace and fellowships of
single households; his longing was, and had ever been-- he had
inherited it from his father--to see one unbroken and harmonious
Grandissime family gathering yearly under this venerated roof
without reproach before all persons, classes, and races with whom
they had ever had to do. It was not hard for the old mansion to
forgive him once or twice; but she had had to do it often. It seems
no over-stretch of fancy to say she sometimes gazed down upon his
erring ways with a look of patient sadness in her large and
beautiful windows.</p>
<p>And how had that forbearance been rewarded? Take one short
instance: when, seven years before this present <i>f&ecirc;te de
grandp&egrave;re</i>, he came back from Europe, and she (this old
home which we cannot help but personify), though in trouble then--a
trouble that sent up the old feud flames again--opened her halls to
rejoice in him with the joy of all her gathered families, he
presently said such strange things in favor of indiscriminate human
freedom that for very shame's sake she hushed them up, in the fond
hope that he would outgrow such heresies. But he? On top of all the
rest, he declined a military commission and engaged in
commerce--"shopkeeping, <i>parbleu!</i>"</p>
<p>However, therein was developed a grain of consolation.
Honor&eacute; became--as he chose to call it--more prudent. With
much tact, Agricola was amiably crowded off the dictator's chair,
to become, instead, a sort of seneschal. For a time the family
peace was perfect, and Honor&eacute;, by a touch here to-day and a
word there to-morrow, was ever lifting the name, and all who bore
it, a little and a little higher; when suddenly, as in his father's
day--that dear Numa who knew how to sacrifice his very soul, as a
sort of Iphigenia for the propitiation of the family gods--as in
Numa's day came the cession to Spain, so now fell this other
cession, like an unexpected tornado, threatening the wreck of her
children's slave-schooners and the prostration alike of their
slave-made crops and their Spanish liberties; and just in the
fateful moment where Numa would have stood by her, Honor&eacute;
had let go. Ah, it was bitter!</p>
<p>"See what foreign education does!" cried a Mandarin de
Grandissime of the Baton Rouge Coast. "I am sorry
now"--derisively--"that I never sent <i>my</i> boy to France, am I
not? No! No-o-o! I would rather my son should never know how to
read, than that he should come back from Paris repudiating the
sentiments and prejudices of his own father. Is education better
than family peace? Ah, bah! My son make friends with
Am&eacute;ricains and tell me they--that call a negro
'monsieur'--are as good as his father? But that is what we get for
letting Honor&eacute; become a merchant. Ha! the degradation!
Shaking hands with men who do not believe in the slave trade! Shake
hands? Yes; associate--fraternize! with apothecaries and
negrophiles. And now we are invited to meet at the <i>f&ecirc;te de
grandp&egrave;re</i>, in the house where he is really the
chief--the <i>ca&ccedil;ique!</i>"</p>
<p>No! The family would not come together on the first appointment;
no, nor on the second; no, not if the grandpapa did express his
wish; no, nor on the third--nor on the fourth.</p>
<p>"<i>Non, Messieurs</i>!" cried both youth and reckless age; and,
sometimes, also, the stronger heads of the family, the men of
means, of force and of influence, urged on from behind by their
proud and beautiful wives and daughters.</p>
<p>Arms, generally, rather than heads, ruled there in those days.
Sentiments (which are the real laws) took shape in accordance with
the poetry, rather than the reason, of things, and the community
recognized the supreme domination of "the gentleman" in questions
of right and of "the ladies" in matters of sentiment. Under such
conditions strength establishes over weakness a showy protection
which is the subtlest of tyrannies, yet which, in the very moment
of extending its arm over woman, confers upon her a power which a
truer freedom would only diminish; constitutes her in a large
degree an autocrat of public sentiment and thus accepts her
narrowest prejudices and most belated errors as veriest need-be's
of social life.</p>
<p>The clans classified easily into three groups; there were those
who boiled, those who stewed, and those who merely steamed under a
close cover. The men in the first two groups were, for the most
part, those who were holding office under old Spanish commissions,
and were daily expecting themselves to be displaced and Louisiana
thereby ruined. The steaming ones were a goodly fraction of the
family--the timid, the apathetic, the "conservative." The
conservatives found ease better than exactitude, the trouble of
thinking great, the agony of deciding harrowing, and the
alternative of smiling cynically and being liberal so much
easier--and the warm weather coming on with a rapidity-wearying to
contemplate.</p>
<p>"The Yankee was an inferior animal."</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"But Honor&eacute; had a right to his convictions."</p>
<p>"Yes, that was so, too."</p>
<p>"It looked very traitorous, however."</p>
<p>"Yes, so it did."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, it might turn out that Honor&eacute; was
advancing the true interests of his people."</p>
<p>"Very likely."</p>
<p>"It would not do to accept office under the Yankee
government."</p>
<p>"Of course not."</p>
<p>"Yet it would never do to let the Yankees get the offices,
either."</p>
<p>"That was true; nobody could deny that."</p>
<p>"If Spain or France got the country back, they would certainly
remember and reward those who had held out faithfully."</p>
<p>"Certainly! That was an old habit with France and Spain."</p>
<p>"But if they did not get the country back--"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is so; Honor&eacute; is a very good fellow,
and--"</p>
<p>And, one after another, under the mild coolness of
Honor&eacute;'s amiable disregard, their indignation trickled back
from steam to water, and they went on drawing their stipends, some
in Honor&eacute;'s counting-room, where they held positions, some
from the provisional government, which had as yet made but few
changes, and some, secretly, from the cunning Casa-Calvo; for, blow
the wind east or blow the wind west, the affinity of the average
Grandissime for a salary abideth forever.</p>
<p>Then, at the right moment, Honor&eacute; made a single happy
stroke, and even the hot Grandissimes, they of the interior
parishes and they of Agricola's squadron, slaked and crumbled when
he wrote each a letter saying that the governor was about to send
them appointments, and that it would be well, if they wished to
<i>evade</i> them, to write the governor at once, surrendering
their present commissions. Well! Evade? They would evade nothing!
Do you think they would so belittle themselves as to write to the
usurper? They would submit to keep the positions first.</p>
<p>But the next move was Honor&eacute;'s making the whole town
aware of his apostasy. The great mansion, with the old
grandp&egrave;re sitting out in front, shivered. As we have seen,
he had ridden through the Place d'Armes with the arch-usurper
himself. Yet, after all, a Grandissime would be a Grandissime
still; whatever he did he did openly. And wasn't that
glorious--never to be ashamed of anything, no matter how bad? It
was not everyone who could ride with the governor.</p>
<p>And blood was so much thicker than vinegar that the family, that
would not meet either in January or February, met in the first week
of March, every constituent one of them.</p>
<p>The feast has been eaten. The garden now is joyous with children
and the veranda resplendent with ladies. From among the latter the
eye quickly selects one. She is perceptibly taller than the others;
she sits in their midst near the great hall entrance; and as you
look at her there is no claim of ancestry the Grandissimes can make
which you would not allow. Her hair, once black, now lifted up into
a glistening snow-drift, augments the majesty of a still beautiful
face, while her full stature and stately bearing suggest the finer
parts of Agricola, her brother. It is Madame Grandissime, the
mother of Honor&eacute;.</p>
<p>One who sits at her left, and is very small, is a favorite
cousin. On her right is her daughter, the widowed se&ntilde;ora of
Jos&eacute; Martinez; she has wonderful black hair and a white brow
as wonderful. The commanding carriage of the mother is tempered in
her to a gentle dignity and calm, contrasting pointedly with the
animated manners of the courtly matrons among whom she sits, and
whose continuous conversation takes this direction or that, at the
pleasure of Madame Grandissime.</p>
<p>But if you can command your powers of attention, despite those
children who are shouting Creole French and sliding down the rails
of the front stair, turn the eye to the laughing squadron of
beautiful girls, which every few minutes, at an end of the veranda,
appears, wheels and disappears, and you note, as it were by
flashes, the characteristics of face and figure that mark the
Louisianaises in the perfection of the new-blown flower. You see
that blondes are not impossible; there, indeed, are two sisters who
might be undistinguishable twins but that one has blue eyes and
golden hair. You note the exquisite pencilling of their eyebrows,
here and there some heavier and more velvety, where a less
vivacious expression betrays a share of Spanish blood. As
Grandissimes, you mark their tendency to exceed the medium Creole
stature, an appearance heightened by the fashion of their robes.
There is scarcely a rose in all their cheeks, and a full
red-ripeness of the lips would hardly be in keeping; but there is
plenty of life in their eyes, which glance out between the curtains
of their long lashes with a merry dancing that keeps time to the
prattle of tongues. You are not able to get a straight look into
them, and if you could you would see only your own image cast back
in pitiful miniature; but you turn away and feel, as you fortify
yourself with an inward smile, that they know you, you man, through
and through, like a little song. And in turning, your sight is glad
to rest again on the face of Honor&eacute;'s mother. You see, this
time, that she <i>is</i> his mother, by a charm you had overlooked,
a candid, serene and lovable smile. It is the wonder of those who
see that smile that she can ever be harsh.</p>
<p>The playful, mock-martial tread of the delicate Creole feet is
all at once swallowed up by the sound of many heavier steps in the
hall, and the fathers, grandfathers, sons, brothers, uncles and
nephews of the great family come out, not a man of them that
cannot, with a little care, keep on his feet. Their descendants of
the present day sip from shallower glasses and with less marked
results.</p>
<p>The matrons, rising, offer the chief seat to the first comer,
the great-grandsire--the oldest living Grandissime--Alcibiade, a
shaken but unfallen monument of early colonial days, a browned and
corrugated souvenir of De Vaudreuil's pomps, of O'Reilly's iron
rule, of Galvez' brilliant wars--a man who had seen Bienville and
Zephyr Grandissime. With what splendor of manner Madame Fusilier de
Grandissime offers, and he accepts, the place of honor! Before he
sits down he pauses a moment to hear out the companion on whose arm
he had been leaning. But Th&eacute;ophile, a dark, graceful youth
of eighteen, though he is recounting something with all the
oblivious ardor of his kind, becomes instantly silent, bows with
grave deference to the ladies, hands the aged forefather gracefully
to his seat, and turning, recommences the recital before one who
hears all with the same perfect courtesy--his beloved cousin
Honor&eacute;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the gentlemen throng out. Gallant crew! These are
they who have been pausing proudly week after week in an endeavor
(?) to understand the opaque motives of Numa's son.</p>
<p>In the middle of the veranda pauses a tall, muscular man of
fifty, with the usual smooth face and an iron-gray queue. That is
Colonel Agamemnon Brahmin de Grandissime, purveyor to the family's
military pride, conservator of its military glory, and, after
Honor&eacute;, the most admired of the name. Achille Grandissime,
he who took Agricola away from Frowenfeld's shop in the carriage,
essays to engage Agamemnon in conversation, and the colonel, with a
glance at his kinsman's nether limbs and another at his own, and
with that placid facility with which the graver sort of Creoles
take up the trivial topics of the lighter, grapples the subject of
boots. A tall, bronzed, slender young man, who prefixes to
Grandissime the maternal St. Blancard, asks where his wife is, is
answered from a distance, throws her a kiss and sits down on a
step, with Jean Baptiste de Grandissime, a piratical-looking
black-beard, above him, and Alphonse Mandarin, an olive-skinned
boy, below. Valentine Grandissime, of Tchoupitoulas, goes quite
down to the bottom of the steps and leans against the balustrade.
He is a large, broad-shouldered, well-built man, and, as he stands
smoking a cigar, with his black-stockinged legs crossed, he glances
at the sky with the eye of a hunter--or, it may be, of a
sailor.</p>
<p>"Valentine will not marry," says one of two ladies who lean over
the rail of the veranda above. "I wonder why."</p>
<p>The other fixes on her a meaning look, and she twitches her
shoulders and pouts, seeing she has asked a foolish question, the
answer to which would only put Valentine in a numerous class and do
him no credit.</p>
<p>Such were the choice spirits of the family. Agricola had
retired. Raoul was there; his pretty auburn head might have been
seen about half-way up the steps, close to one well sprinkled with
premature gray.</p>
<p>"No such thing!" exclaimed his companion.</p>
<p>(The conversation was entirely in Creole French.)</p>
<p>"I give you my sacred word of honor!" cried Raoul.</p>
<p>"That Honor&eacute; is having all his business carried on in
English?" asked the incredulous Sylvestre. (Such was his name.)</p>
<p>"I swear--" replied Raoul, resorting to his favorite pledge--"on
a stack of Bibles that high!"</p>
<p>"Ah-h-h-h, pf-f-f-f-f!"</p>
<p>This polite expression of unbelief was further emphasized by a
spasmodic flirt of one hand, with the thumb pointed outward.</p>
<p>"Ask him! ask him!" cried Raoul.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;!" called Sylvestre, rising up. Two or three
persons passed the call around the corner of the veranda.</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; came with a chain of six girls on either arm. By
the time he arrived, there was a Babel of discussion.</p>
<p>"Raoul says you have ordered all your books and accounts to be
written in English," said Sylvestre.</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"It is not true, is it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The entire veranda of ladies raised one long-drawn, deprecatory
"Ah!" except Honor&eacute;'s mother. She turned upon him a look of
silent but intense and indignant disappointment.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;!" cried Sylvestre, desirous of repairing his
defeat, "Honor&eacute;!"</p>
<p>But Honor&eacute; was receiving the clamorous abuse of the two
half dozens of girls.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;!" cried Sylvestre again, holding up a torn scrap
of writing-paper which bore the marks of the counting-room floor
and of a boot-heel, "how do you spell 'la-dee?'"</p>
<p>There was a moment's hush to hear the answer.</p>
<p>"Ask Valentine," said Honor&eacute;.</p>
<p>Everybody laughed aloud. That taciturn man's only retort was to
survey the company above him with an unmoved countenance, and to
push the ashes slowly from his cigar with his little finger. M.
Valentine Grandissime, of Tchoupitoulas, could not read.</p>
<p>"Show it to Agricola," cried two or three, as that great man
came out upon the veranda, heavy-eyed, and with tumbled hair.</p>
<p>Sylvestre, spying Agricola's head beyond the ladies, put the
question.</p>
<p>"How is it spelled on that paper?" retorted the king of
beasts.</p>
<p>"L-a-y--"</p>
<p>"Ignoramus!" growled the old man.</p>
<p>"I did not spell it," cried Raoul, and attempted to seize the
paper. But Sylvestre throwing his hand behind him, a lady snatched
the paper, two or three cried "Give it to Agricola!" and a pretty
boy, whom the laughter and excitement had lured from the garden,
scampered up the steps and handed it to the old man.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;!" cried Raoul, "it must not be read. It is one of
your private matters."</p>
<p>But Raoul's insinuation that anybody would entrust him with a
private matter brought another laugh.</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; nodded to his uncle to read it out, and those who
could not understand English, as well as those who could, listened.
It was a paper Sylvestre had picked out of a waste-basket on the
day of Aurore's visit to the counting-room. Agricola read:</p>
<blockquote>"What is that layde want in thare with
Honor&eacute;?"<br>
"Honor&eacute; is goin giv her bac that proprety--that is<br>
Aurore De Grapion what Agricola kill the husband."</blockquote>
<p>That was the whole writing, but Agricola never finished. He was
reading aloud--"that is Aurore De Grap--"</p>
<p>At that moment he dropped the paper and blackened with wrath; a
sharp flash of astonishment ran through the company; an instant of
silence followed and Agricola's thundering voice rolled down upon
Sylvestre in a succession of terrible imprecations.</p>
<p>It was painful to see the young man's face as, speechless, he
received this abuse. He stood pale and frightened, with a smile
playing about his mouth, half of distress and half of defiance,
that said as plain as a smile could say, "Uncle Agricola, you will
have to pay for this mistake."</p>
<p>As the old man ceased, Sylvestre turned and cast a look downward
to Valentine Grandissime, then walked up the steps, and passing
with a courteous bow through the group that surrounded Agricola,
went into the house. Valentine looked at the zenith, then at his
shoe-buckles, tossed his cigar quietly into the grass and passed
around a corner of the house to meet Sylvestre in the rear.</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; had already nodded to his uncle to come aside with
him, and Agricola had done so. The rest of the company, save a few
male figures down in the garden, after some feeble efforts to keep
up their spirits on the veranda, remarked the growing coolness or
the waning daylight, and singly or in pairs withdrew. It was not
long before Raoul, who had come up upon the veranda, was left
alone. He seemed to wait for something, as, leaning over the rail
while the stars came out, he sang to himself, in a soft undertone,
a snatch of a Creole song:</p>
<blockquote>"La pluie--la pluie tombait,<br>
Crapaud criait,<br>
Moustique chantait--"</blockquote>
<p>The moon shone so brightly that the children in the garden did
not break off their hide-and-seek, and now and then Raoul suspended
the murmur of his song, absorbed in the fate of some little elf
gliding from one black shadow to crouch in another. He was himself
in the deep shade of a magnolia, over whose outer boughs the
moonlight was trickling, as if the whole tree had been dipped in
quicksilver.</p>
<p>In the broad walk running down to the garden gate some six or
seven dark forms sat in chairs, not too far away for the light of
their cigars to be occasionally seen and their voices to reach his
ear; but he did not listen. In a little while there came a light
footstep, and a soft, mock-startled "Who is that?" and one of that
same sparkling group of girls that had lately hung upon
Honor&eacute; came so close to Raoul, in her attempt to discern his
lineaments, that their lips accidentally met. They had but a moment
of hand-in-hand converse before they were hustled forth by a
feminine scouting party and thrust along into one of the great
rooms of the house, where the youth and beauty of the Grandissimes
were gathered in an expansive semicircle around a languishing fire,
waiting to hear a story, or a song, or both, or half a dozen of
each, from that master of narrative and melody, Raoul
Innerarity.</p>
<p>"But mark," they cried unitedly, "you have got to wind up with
the story of Bras-Coup&eacute;!"</p>
<p>"A song! A song!"</p>
<p>"<i>Une chanson Cr&eacute;ole! Une chanson des
n&egrave;gres!</i>"</p>
<p>"Sing 'y&eacute; tol&eacute; danc&eacute; la doung y doung
doung!'" cried a black-eyed girl.</p>
<p>Raoul explained that it had too many objectionable phrases.</p>
<p>"Oh, just hum the objectionable phrases and go right on."</p>
<p>But instead he sang them this:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>La pr&eacute;mier' fois mo t&eacute; 'oir li,<br>
Li t&eacute; pos&eacute; au bord so lit;<br>
Mo di', Bouzon, bel n'amour&egrave;se!<br>
L'aut' fois li t&eacute; si' so la saise<br>
Comme vi&eacute; Madam dans so fauteil,<br>
Quand li viv&eacute; c&oacute;t&eacute; soleil.<br>
<br>
So gi&eacute;s y&eacute; t&eacute; plis noir pass&eacute; la
nouitte,<br>
So d&eacute; la lev' plis doux passe la quitte!<br>
Tou' mo la vie, zamein mo oir<br>
Ein n' amour&egrave;se zoli comme &ccedil;a!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mo' bli&eacute; manz&eacute;--mo'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mo' bli&eacute; tout dipi &ccedil;'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mo' bli&eacute; parl&eacute;--mo'
bli&eacute; dormi,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quand mo pens&eacute; apr&eacute;s
zami!</i>"</blockquote>
<p>"And you have heard Bras-Coup&eacute; sing that, yourself?"</p>
<p>"Once upon a time," said Raoul, warming with his subject, "we
were coming down from Pointe Macarty in three pirogues. We had been
three days fishing and hunting in Lake Salvador. Bras-Coup&eacute;
had one pirogue with six paddles--"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!" cried a youth named Baltazar; "sing that, Raoul!"</p>
<p>And he sang that.</p>
<p>"But oh, Raoul, sing that song the negroes sing when they go out
in the bayous at night, stealing pigs and chickens!"</p>
<p>"That boat song, do you mean, which they sing as a signal to
those on shore?" He hummed.</p>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/250.png" width="100%" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>"D&eacute; zabs, d&eacute; zabs, d&eacute; counou
oua&iuml;e oua&iuml;e,<br>
D&eacute; zabs, d&eacute; zabs, d&eacute; counou oua&iuml;e
oua&iuml;e,<br>
Counou oua&iuml;e oua&iuml;e oua&iuml;e oua&iuml;e,<br>

Counou oua&iuml;e oua&iuml;e oua&iuml;e, momza;<br>
Momza, momza, momza, momza,<br>
Roza, roza, roza-et--momza."</blockquote>
<p>This was followed by another and still another, until the hour
began to grow late. And then they gathered closer around him and
heard the promised story. At the same hour Honor&eacute;
Grandissime, wrapping himself in a greatcoat and giving himself up
to sad and somewhat bitter reflections, had wandered from the
paternal house, and by and by from the grounds, not knowing why or
whither, but after a time soliciting, at Frowenfeld's closing door,
the favor of his company. He had been feeling a kind of
suffocation. This it was that made him seek and prize the presence
and hand-grasp of the inexperienced apothecary. He led him out to
the edge of the river. Here they sat down, and with a laborious
attempt at a hard and jesting mood, Honor&eacute; told the same
dark story.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE STORY OF BRAS-COUP&Eacute;</h3>
<br>
<p>"A very little more than eight years ago," began
Honor&eacute;--but not only Honor&eacute;, but Raoul also; and not
only they, but another, earlier on the same day,--Honor&eacute;,
the f.m.c. But we shall not exactly follow the words of any one of
these.</p>
<p>Bras-Coup&eacute;, they said, had been, in Africa and under
another name, a prince among his people. In a certain war of
conquest, to which he had been driven by <i>ennui</i>, he was
captured, stripped of his royalty, marched down upon the beach of
the Atlantic, and, attired as a true son of Adam, with two goodly
arms intact, became a commodity. Passing out of first hands in
barter for a looking-glass, he was shipped in good order and
condition on board the good schooner <i>&Eacute;galit&eacute;</i>,
whereof Blank was master, to be delivered without delay at the port
of Nouvelle Orl&eacute;ans (the dangers of fire and navigation
excepted), unto Blank Blank. In witness whereof, He that made men's
skins of different colors, but all blood of one, hath entered the
same upon His book, and sealed it to the day of judgment.</p>
<p>Of the voyage little is recorded--here below; the less the
better. Part of the living merchandise failed to keep; the weather
was rough, the cargo large, the vessel small. However, the captain
discovered there was room over the side, and there--all flesh is
grass--from time to time during the voyage he jettisoned the
unmerchantable.</p>
<p>Yet, when the reopened hatches let in the sweet smell of the
land, Bras-Coup&eacute; had come to the upper--the favored--the
buttered side of the world; the anchor slid with a rumble of relief
down through the muddy fathoms of the Mississippi, and the prince
could hear through the schooner's side the savage current of the
river, leaping and licking about the bows, and whimpering low
welcomes home. A splendid picture to the eyes of the royal captive,
as his head came up out of the hatchway, was the little
Franco-Spanish-American city that lay on the low, brimming bank.
There were little forts that showed their whitewashed teeth; there
was a green parade-ground, and yellow barracks, and cabildo, and
hospital, and cavalry stables, and custom-house, and a most
inviting jail, convenient to the cathedral--all of dazzling white
and yellow, with a black stripe marking the track of the
conflagration of 1794, and here and there among the low roofs a
lofty one with round-topped dormer windows and a breezy belvidere
looking out upon the plantations of coffee and indigo beyond the
town.</p>
<p>When Bras-Coup&eacute; staggered ashore, he stood but a moment
among a drove of "likely boys," before Agricola Fusilier, managing
the business adventures of the Grandissime estate, as well as the
residents thereon, and struck with admiration for the physical
beauties of the chieftain (a man may even fancy a negro--as a
negro), bought the lot, and, both to resell him with the rest to
some unappreciative 'Cadian, induced Don Jos&eacute; Martinez'
overseer to become his purchaser.</p>
<p>Down in the rich parish of St. Bernard (whose boundary line now
touches that of the distended city) lay the plantation, known
before Bras-Coup&eacute; passed away as La Renaissance. Here it was
that he entered at once upon a chapter of agreeable surprises. He
was humanely met, presented with a clean garment, lifted into a
cart drawn by oxen, taken to a whitewashed cabin of logs, finer
than his palace at home, and made to comprehend that it was a free
gift. He was also given some clean food, whereupon he fell sick. At
home it would have been the part of piety for the magnate next the
throne to launch him heavenward at once; but now, healing doses
were administered, and to his amazement he recovered. It reminded
him that he was no longer king.</p>
<p>His name, he replied to an inquiry touching that subject,
was--------, something in the Jaloff tongue, which he by and by
condescended to render into Congo: Mioko-Koanga; in French
Bras-Coup&eacute;; the Arm Cut Off. Truly it would have been easy
to admit, had this been his meaning, that his tribe, in losing him,
had lost its strong right arm close off at the shoulder; not so
easy for his high-paying purchaser to allow, if this other was his
intent: that the arm which might no longer shake the spear or swing
the wooden sword was no better than a useless stump never to be
lifted for aught else. But whether easy to allow or not, that was
his meaning. He made himself a type of all Slavery, turning into
flesh and blood the truth that all Slavery is maiming.</p>
<p>He beheld more luxury in a week than all his subjects had seen
in a century. Here Congo girls were dressed in cottons and flannels
worth, where he came from, an elephant's tusk apiece. Everybody
wore clothes--children and lads alone excepted. Not a lion had
invaded the settlement since his immigration. The serpents were as
nothing; an occasional one coming up through the floor--that was
all. True, there was more emaciation than unassisted conjecture
could explain--a profusion of enlarged joints and diminished
muscles, which, thank God, was even then confined to a narrow
section and disappeared with Spanish rule. He had no experimental
knowledge of it; nay, regular meals, on the contrary, gave him
anxious concern, yet had the effect--spite of his apprehension that
he was being fattened for a purpose--of restoring the herculean
puissance which formerly in Africa had made him the terror of the
battle.</p>
<p>When one day he had come to be quite himself, he was invited out
into the sunshine, and escorted by the driver (a sort of foreman to
the overseer), went forth dimly wondering. They reached a field
where some men and women were hoeing. He had seen men and
women--subjects of his--labor--a little--in Africa. The driver
handed him a hoe; he examined it with silent interest--until by
signs he was requested to join the pastime.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He spoke, not with his lips, but with the recoil of his splendid
frame and the ferocious expansion of his eyes. This invitation was
a cataract of lightning leaping down an ink-black sky. In one
instant of all-pervading clearness he read his sentence--WORK.</p>
<p>Bras-Coup&eacute; was six feet five. With a sweep as quick as
instinct the back of the hoe smote the driver full in the head.
Next, the prince lifted the nearest Congo crosswise, brought
thirty-two teeth together in his wildly kicking leg and cast him
away as a bad morsel; then, throwing another into the branches of a
willow, and a woman over his head into a draining-ditch, he made
one bound for freedom, and fell to his knees, rocking from side to
side under the effect of a pistol-ball from the overseer. It had
struck him in the forehead, and running around the skull in search
of a penetrable spot, tradition--which sometimes jests--says came
out despairingly, exactly where it had entered.</p>
<p>It so happened that, except the overseer, the whole company were
black. Why should the trivial scandal be blabbed? A plaster or two
made everything even in a short time, except in the driver's
case--for the driver died. The woman whom Bras-Coup&eacute; had
thrown over his head lived to sell <i>calas</i> to Joseph
Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute;, young and austere, knew nothing about
agriculture and cared as much about human nature. The overseer
often thought this, but never said it; he would not trust even
himself with the dangerous criticism. When he ventured to reveal
the foregoing incidents to the se&ntilde;or he laid all the blame
possible upon the man whom death had removed beyond the reach of
correction, and brought his account to a climax by hazarding the
asserting that Bras-Coup&eacute; was an animal that could not be
whipped.</p>
<p>"Caramba!" exclaimed the master, with gentle emphasis, "how
so?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps se&ntilde;or had better ride down to the quarters,"
replied the overseer.</p>
<p>It was a great sacrifice of dignity, but the master made it.</p>
<p>"Bring him out."</p>
<p>They brought him out--chains on his feet, chains on his wrists,
an iron yoke on his neck. The Spanish Creole master had often seen
the bull, with his long, keen horns and blazing eye, standing in
the arena; but this was as though he had come face to face with a
rhinoceros.</p>
<p>"This man is not a Congo," he said.</p>
<p>"He is a Jaloff," replied the encouraged overseer. "See his
fine, straight nose; moreover, he is a <i>candio</i>--a prince. If
I whip him he will die."</p>
<p>The dauntless captive and fearless master stood looking into
each other's eyes until each recognized in the other his peer in
physical courage, and each was struck with an admiration for the
other which no after difference was sufficient entirely to destroy.
Had Bras-Coup&eacute;'s eye quailed but once--just for one little
instant--he would have got the lash; but, as it was--</p>
<p>"Get an interpreter," said Don Jos&eacute;; then, more
privately, "and come to an understanding. I shall require it of
you."</p>
<p>Where might one find an interpreter--one not merely able to
render a Jaloff's meaning into Creole French, or Spanish, but with
such a turn for diplomatic correspondence as would bring about an
"understanding" with this African buffalo? The overseer was left
standing and thinking, and Clemence, who had not forgotten who
threw her into the draining-ditch, cunningly passed by.</p>
<p>"Ah, Clemence--"</p>
<p>"<i>Mo pas capabe! Mo pas capabe!</i> (I cannot, I cannot!)
<i>Ya, ya, ya! 'oir Mich&eacute; Agricol' Fusilier! ouala yune bon
monture, oui!</i>"--which was to signify that Agricola could
interpret the very Papa L&eacute;bat.</p>
<p>"Agricola Fusilier! The last man on earth to make peace."</p>
<p>But there seemed to be no choice, and to Agricola the overseer
went. It was but a little ride to the Grandissime place.</p>
<p>"I, Agricola Fusilier, stand as an interpreter to a negro?
H-sir!"</p>
<p>"But I thought you might know of some person," said the
weakening applicant, rubbing his ear with his hand.</p>
<p>"Ah!" replied Agricola, addressing the surrounding scenery, "if
I did not--who would? You may take Palmyre."</p>
<p>The overseer softly smote his hands together at the happy
thought.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Agricola, "take Palmyre; she has picked up as many
negro dialects as I know European languages."</p>
<p>And she went to the don's plantation as interpreter, followed by
Agricola's prayer to Fate that she might in some way be overtaken
by disaster. The two hated each other with all the strength they
had. He knew not only her pride, but her passion for the absent
Honor&eacute;. He hated her, also, for her intelligence, for the
high favor in which she stood with her mistress, and for her
invincible spirit, which was more offensively patent to him than to
others, since he was himself the chief object of her silent
detestation.</p>
<p>It was Palmyre's habit to do nothing without painstaking. "When
Mademoiselle comes to be Se&ntilde;ora," thought she--she knew that
her mistress and the don were affianced--"it will be well to have a
Se&ntilde;or's esteem. I shall endeavor to succeed." It was from
this motive, then, that with the aid of her mistress she attired
herself in a resplendence of scarlet and beads and feathers that
could not fail the double purpose of connecting her with the
children of Ethiopia and commanding the captive's instant
admiration.</p>
<p>Alas for those who succeed too well! No sooner did the African
turn his tiger glance upon her than the fire of his eyes died out;
and when she spoke to him in the dear accents of his native tongue,
the matter of strife vanished from his mind. He loved.</p>
<p>He sat down tamely in his irons and listened to Palmyre's
argument as a wrecked mariner would listen to ghostly church-bells.
He would give a short assent, feast his eyes, again assent, and
feast his ears; but when at length she made bold to approach the
actual issue, and finally uttered the loathed word, <i>Work</i>, he
rose up, six feet five, a statue of indignation in black
marble.</p>
<p>And then Palmyre, too, rose up, glorying in him, and went to
explain to master and overseer. Bras-Coup&eacute; understood, she
said, that he was a slave--it was the fortune of war, and he was a
warrior; but, according to a generally recognized principle in
African international law, he could not reasonably be expected to
work.</p>
<p>"As Se&ntilde;or will remember I told him," remarked the
overseer; "how can a man expect to plow with a zebra?"</p>
<p>Here he recalled a fact in his earlier experience. An African of
this stripe had been found to answer admirably as a "driver" to
make others work. A second and third parley, extending through two
or three days, were held with the prince, looking to his
appointment to the vacant office of driver; yet what was the
master's amazement to learn at length that his Highness declined
the proffered honor.</p>
<p>"Stop!" spoke the overseer again, detecting a look of alarm in
Palmyre's face as she turned away, "he doesn't do any such thing.
If Se&ntilde;or will let me take the man to Agricola--"</p>
<p>"No!" cried Palmyre, with an agonized look, "I will tell. He
will take the place and fill it if you will give me to him for his
own--but oh, messieurs, for the love of God--I do not want to be
his wife!"</p>
<p>The overseer looked at the Se&ntilde;or, ready to approve
whatever he should decide. Bras-Coup&eacute;'s intrepid audacity
took the Spaniard's heart by irresistible assault.</p>
<p>"I leave it entirely with Se&ntilde;or Fusilier," he said.</p>
<p>"But he is not my master; he has no right--"</p>
<p>"Silence!"</p>
<p>And she was silent; and so, sometimes, is fire in the wall.</p>
<p>Agricola's consent was given with malicious promptness, and as
Bras-Coup&eacute;'s fetters fell off it was decreed that, should he
fill his office efficiently, there should be a wedding on the rear
veranda of the Grandissime mansion simultaneously with the one
already appointed to take place in the grand hall of the same house
six months from that present day. In the meanwhile Palmyre should
remain with Mademoiselle, who had promptly but quietly made up her
mind that Palmyre should not be wed unless she wished to be.
Bras-Coup&eacute; made no objection, was royally worthless for a
time, but learned fast, mastered the "gumbo" dialect in a few
weeks, and in six months was the most valuable man ever bought for
gourde dollars. Nevertheless, there were but three persons within
as many square miles who were not most vividly afraid of him.</p>
<p>The first was Palmyre. His bearing in her presence was ever one
of solemn, exalted respect, which, whether from pure magnanimity in
himself, or by reason of her magnetic eye, was something worth
being there to see. "It was royal!" said the overseer.</p>
<p>The second was not that official. When Bras-Coup&eacute;
said--as, at stated intervals, he did say--"<i>Mo courri c'ez
Agricole Fusilier pou' 'oir 'namourouse</i> (I go to Agricola
Fusilier to see my betrothed,)" the overseer would sooner have
intercepted a score of painted Chickasaws than that one lover. He
would look after him and shake a prophetic head. "Trouble coming;
better not deceive that fellow;" yet that was the very thing
Palmyre dared do. Her admiration for Bras-Coup&eacute; was almost
boundless. She rejoiced in his stature; she revelled in the
contemplation of his untamable spirit; he seemed to her the
gigantic embodiment of her own dark, fierce will, the expanded
realization of her lifetime longing for terrible strength. But the
single deficiency in all this impassioned regard was--what so many
fairer loves have found impossible to explain to so many gentler
lovers--an entire absence of preference; her heart she could not
give him--she did not have it. Yet after her first prayer to the
Spaniard and his overseer for deliverance, to the secret surprise
and chagrin of her young mistress, she simulated content. It was
artifice; she knew Agricola's power, and to seem to consent was her
one chance with him. He might thus be beguiled into withdrawing his
own consent. That failing, she had Mademoiselle's promise to come
to the rescue, which she could use at the last moment; and that
failing, there was a dirk in her bosom, for which a certain hard
breast was not too hard. Another element of safety, of which she
knew nothing, was a letter from the Cannes Brul&eacute;e. The word
had reached there that love had conquered--that, despite all hard
words, and rancor, and positive injury, the Grandissime hand--the
fairest of Grandissime hands--was about to be laid into that of one
who without much stretch might be called a De Grapion; that there
was, moreover, positive effort being made to induce a restitution
of old gaming-table spoils. Honor&eacute; and Mademoiselle, his
sister, one on each side of the Atlantic, were striving for this
end. Don Jos&eacute; sent this intelligence to his kinsman as glad
tidings (a lover never imagines there are two sides to that which
makes him happy), and, to add a touch of humor, told how Palmyre,
also, was given to the chieftain. The letter that came back to the
young Spaniard did not blame him so much: <i>he</i> was ignorant of
all the facts; but a very formal one to Agricola begged to notify
him that if Palmyre's union with Bras-Coup&eacute; should be
completed, as sure as there was a God in heaven, the writer would
have the life of the man who knowingly had thus endeavored to
dishonor one who <i>shared the blood of the De Grapions</i>.
Thereupon Agricola, contrary to his general character, began to
drop hints to Don Jos&eacute; that the engagement of
Bras-Coup&eacute; and Palmyre need not be considered irreversible;
but the don was not desirous of disappointing his terrible pet.
Palmyre, unluckily, played her game a little too deeply. She
thought the moment had come for herself to insist on the match, and
thus provoke Agricola to forbid it. To her incalculable dismay she
saw him a second time reconsider and become silent.</p>
<p>The second person who did not fear Bras-Coup&eacute; was
Mademoiselle. On one of the giant's earliest visits to see Palmyre
he obeyed the summons which she brought him, to appear before the
lady. A more artificial man might have objected on the score of
dress, his attire being a single gaudy garment tightly enveloping
the waist and thighs. As his eyes fell upon the beautiful white
lady he prostrated himself upon the ground, his arms outstretched
before him. He would not move till she was gone. Then he arose like
a hermit who has seen a vision. "<i>Bras-Coup&eacute; n' pas
oul&eacute; oir zombis</i> (Bras-Coup&eacute; dares not look upon a
spirit)." From that hour he worshipped. He saw her often; every
time, after one glance at her countenance, he would prostrate his
gigantic length with his face in the dust.</p>
<p>The third person who did not fear him was--Agricola? Nay, it was
the Spaniard--a man whose capability to fear anything in nature or
beyond had never been discovered.</p>
<p>Long before the end of his probation Bras-Coup&eacute; would
have slipped the entanglements of bondage, though as yet he felt
them only as one feels a spider's web across the face, had not the
master, according to a little affectation of the times, promoted
him to be his game-keeper. Many a day did these two living
magazines of wrath spend together in the dismal swamps and on the
meagre intersecting ridges, making war upon deer and bear and
wildcat; or on the Mississippi after wild goose and pelican; when
even a word misplaced would have made either the slayer of the
other. Yet the months ran smoothly round and the wedding night drew
nigh<a name="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3">[3]</a>. A goodly
company had assembled. All things were ready. The bride was
dressed, the bridegroom had come. On the great back piazza, which
had been inclosed with sail-cloth and lighted with lanterns, was
Palmyre, full of a new and deep design and playing her deceit to
the last, robed in costly garments to whose beauty was added the
charm of their having been worn once, and once only, by her beloved
Mademoiselle.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor3">[3]</a>
An over-zealous Franciscan once complained bitterly to the bishop
of Havana, that people were being married in Louisiana in their own
houses after dark and thinking nothing of it. It is not certain
that he had reference to the Grandissime mansion; at any rate he
was tittered down by the whole community.</blockquote>
<p>But where was Bras-Coup&eacute;?</p>
<p>The question was asked of Palmyre by Agricola with a gaze that
meant in English, "No tricks, girl!"</p>
<p>Among the servants who huddled at the windows and door to see
the inner magnificence a frightened whisper was already going
round.</p>
<p>"We have made a sad discovery, Mich&eacute; Fusilier," said the
overseer. "Bras-Coup&eacute; is here; we have him in a room just
yonder. But--the truth is, sir, Bras-Coup&eacute; is a voudou."</p>
<p>"Well, and suppose he is; what of it? Only hush; do not let his
master know it. It is nothing; all the blacks are voudous, more or
less."</p>
<p>"But he declines to dress himself--has painted himself all rings
and stripes, antelope fashion."</p>
<p>"Tell him Agricola Fusilier says, 'dress immediately!'"</p>
<p>"Oh, Mich&eacute;, we have said that five times already, and his
answer--you will pardon me--his answer is--spitting on the
ground--that you are a contemptible <i>dotchian</i> (white
trash)."</p>
<p>There is nothing to do but privily to call the very bride--the
lady herself. She comes forth in all her glory, small, but oh, so
beautiful! Slam! Bras-Coup&eacute; is upon his face, his
finger-tips touching the tips of her snowy slippers. She gently
bids him go and dress, and at once he goes.</p>
<p>Ah! now the question may be answered without whispering. There
is Bras-Coup&eacute;, towering above all heads, in ridiculous red
and blue regimentals, but with a look of savage dignity upon him
that keeps every one from laughing. The murmur of admiration that
passed along the thronged gallery leaped up into a shout in the
bosom of Palmyre. Oh, Bras-Coup&eacute;--heroic soul! She would not
falter. She would let the silly priest say his say--then her
cunning should help her <i>not to be</i> his wife, yet to show his
mighty arm how and when to strike.</p>
<p>"He is looking for Palmyre," said some, and at that moment he
saw her.</p>
<p>"Ho-o-o-o-o!"</p>
<p>Agricola's best roar was a penny trumpet to Bras-Coup&eacute;'s
note of joy. The whole masculine half of the indoor company flocked
out to see what the matter was. Bras-Coup&eacute; was taking her
hand in one of his and laying his other upon her head; and as some
one made an unnecessary gesture for silence, he sang, beating slow
and solemn time with his naked foot and with the hand that dropped
hers to smite his breast:</p>
<blockquote>"'<i>En haut la montagne, zami,<br>
Mo p&eacute; coup&eacute; canne, zami,<br>
Pou' f&eacute; l'a'zen' zami,<br>
Pou' mo baille Palmyre.<br>
Ah! Palmyre, Palmyre mo c'ere,<br>
Mo l'aim&eacute; 'ou'--mo l'aim&eacute; 'ou'</i>.'"</blockquote>
<p>"<i>Montagne?</i>" asked one slave of another, "<i>qui est
&ccedil;&agrave;, montagne? gnia pas qui&ccedil; 'ose comme
&ccedil;&agrave; dans la Louisiana?</i> (What's a mountain?" We
haven't such things in Louisiana.)"</p>
<p>"<i>Mein ye gagnein plein montagnes dans l'Afrique</i>,
listen!"</p>
<blockquote>"'<i>Ah! Palmyre, Palmyre, mo' piti zozo,'<br>
Mo l'aim&eacute; 'ou'--mo l'aim&eacute;, l'aim&eacute;
'ou'</i>.'"</blockquote>
<p>"Bravissimo!--" but just then a counter-attraction drew the
white company back into the house. An old French priest with
sandalled feet and a dirty face had arrived. There was a moment of
handshaking with the good father, then a moment of palpitation and
holding of the breath, and then--you would have known it by the
turning away of two or three feminine heads in tears--the lily hand
became the don's, to have and to hold, by authority of the Church
and the Spanish king. And all was merry, save that outside there
was coming up as villanous a night as ever cast black looks in
through snug windows.</p>
<p>It was just as the newly-wed Spaniard, with Agricola and all the
guests, were concluding the byplay of marrying the darker couple,
that the hurricane struck the dwelling. The holy and jovial father
had made faint pretence of kissing this second bride; the ladies,
colonels, dons, etc.,--though the joke struck them as a trifle
coarse--were beginning to laugh and clap hands again and the gowned
jester to bow to right and left, when Bras-Coup&eacute;, tardily
realizing the consummation of his hopes, stepped forward to embrace
his wife.</p>
<p>"Bras-Coup&eacute;!"</p>
<p>The voice was that of Palmyre's mistress. She had not been able
to comprehend her maid's behavior, but now Palmyre had darted upon
her an appealing look.</p>
<p>The warrior stopped as if a javelin had flashed over his head
and stuck in the wall.</p>
<p>"Bras-Coup&eacute; must wait till I give him his wife."</p>
<p>He sank, with hidden face, slowly to the floor.</p>
<p>"Bras-Coup&eacute; hears the voice of zombis; the voice is
sweet, but the words are very strong; from the same sugar-cane
comes <i>sirop</i> and <i>tafia</i>; Bras-Coup&eacute; says to
zombis, 'Bras-Coup&eacute; will wait; but if the <i>dotchians</i>
deceive Bras-Coup&eacute;--" he rose to his feet with his eyes
closed and his great black fist lifted over his
head--"Bras-Coup&eacute; will call Voudou-Magnan!"</p>
<p>The crowd retreated and the storm fell like a burst of infernal
applause. A whiff like fifty witches flouted up the canvas curtain
of the gallery and a fierce black cloud, drawing the moon under its
cloak, belched forth a stream of fire that seemed to flood the
ground; a peal of thunder followed as if the sky had fallen in, the
house quivered, the great oaks groaned, and every lesser thing
bowed down before the awful blast. Every lip held its breath for a
minute--or an hour, no one knew--there was a sudden lull of the
wind, and the floods came down. Have you heard it thunder and rain
in those Louisiana lowlands? Every clap seems to crack the world.
It has rained a moment; you peer through the black pane--your house
is an island, all the land is sea.</p>
<p>However, the supper was spread in the hall and in due time the
guests were filled. Then a supper was spread in the big hall in the
basement, below stairs, the sons and daughters of Ham came down
like the fowls of the air upon a rice-field, and Bras-Coup&eacute;,
throwing his heels about with the joyous carelessness of a smutted
Mercury, for the first time in his life tasted the blood of the
grape. A second, a fifth, a tenth time he tasted it, drinking more
deeply each time, and would have taken it ten times more had not
his bride cunningly concealed it. It was like stealing a tiger's
kittens.</p>
<p>The moment quickly came when he wanted his eleventh bumper. As
he presented his request a silent shiver of consternation ran
through the dark company; and when, in what the prince meant as a
remonstrative tone, he repeated the petition--splitting the table
with his fist by way of punctuation--there ensued a hustling up
staircases and a cramming into dim corners that left him alone at
the banquet.</p>
<p>Leaving the table, he strode upstairs and into the chirruping
and dancing of the grand salon. There was a halt in the cotillion
and a hush of amazement like the shutting off of steam.
Bras-Coup&eacute; strode straight to his master, laid his paw upon
his fellow-bridegroom's shoulder and in a thunder-tone
demanded:</p>
<p>"More!"</p>
<p>The master swore a Spanish oath, lifted his hand and--fell,
beneath the terrific fist of his slave, with a bang that jingled
the candelabra. Dolorous stroke!--for the dealer of it. Given,
apparently to him--poor, tipsy savage--in self-defence, punishable,
in a white offender, by a small fine or a few days' imprisonment,
it assured Bras-Coup&eacute; the death of a felon; such was the old
<i>Code Noir</i>. (We have a <i>Code Noir</i> now, but the new one
is a mental reservation, not an enactment.)</p>
<p>The guests stood for an instant as if frozen, smitten stiff with
the instant expectation of insurrection, conflagration and rapine
(just as we do to-day whenever some poor swaggering Pompey rolls up
his fist and gets a ball through his body), while, single-handed
and naked-fisted in a room full of swords, the giant stood over his
master, making strange signs and passes and rolling out in wrathful
words of his mother tongue what it needed no interpreter to tell
his swarming enemies was a voudou malediction.</p>
<p>"<i>Nous sommes grigis!</i>" screamed two or three ladies, "we
are bewitched!"</p>
<p>"Look to your wives and daughters!" shouted a
Brahmin-Mandarin.</p>
<p>"Shoot the black devils without mercy!" cried a
Mandarin-Fusilier, unconsciously putting into a single outflash of
words the whole Creole treatment of race troubles.</p>

<b>"Bras-Coup&eacute; was practically declaring his independence on
a slight rise of ground hardly sixty feet in circumference and
lifted scarce above the water in the inmost depths of the
swamp".</b></p>
<br>
<p>With a single bound Bras-Coup&eacute; reached the drawing-room
door; his gaudy regimentals made a red and blue streak down the
hall; there was a rush of frilled and powdered gentlemen to the
rear veranda, an avalanche of lightning with Bras-Coup&eacute; in
the midst making for the swamp, and then all without was blackness
of darkness and all within was a wild commingled chatter of Creole,
French, and Spanish tongues,--in the midst of which the reluctant
Agricola returned his dresssword to its scabbard.</p>
<p>While the wet lanterns swung on crazily in the trees along the
way by which the bridegroom was to have borne his bride; while
Madame Grandissime prepared an impromptu bridalchamber; while the
Spaniard bathed his eye and the blue gash on his cheek-bone; while
Palmyre paced her room in a fever and wild tremor of conflicting
emotions throughout the night, and the guests splashed home after
the storm as best they could, Bras-Coup&eacute; was practically
declaring his independence on a slight rise of ground hardly sixty
feet in circumference and lifted scarce above the water in the
inmost depths of the swamp.</p>
<p>And amid what surroundings! Endless colonnades of cypresses;
long, motionless drapings of gray moss; broad sheets of noisome
waters, pitchy black, resting on bottomless ooze; cypress knees
studding the surface; patches of floating green, gleaming
brilliantly here and there; yonder where the sunbeams wedge
themselves in, constellations of water-lilies, the many-hued iris,
and a multitude of flowers that no man had named; here, too,
serpents great and small, of wonderful colorings, and the dull and
loathsome moccasin sliding warily off the dead tree; in dimmer
recesses the cow alligator, with her nest hard by; turtles a
century old; owls and bats, raccoons, opossums, rats, centipedes
and creatures of like vileness; great vines of beautiful leaf and
scarlet fruit in deadly clusters; maddening mosquitoes, parasitic
insects, gorgeous dragon-flies and pretty water-lizards: the blue
heron, the snowy crane, the red-bird, the moss-bird, the night-hawk
and the chuckwill's-widow; a solemn stillness and stifled air only
now and then disturbed by the call or whir of the summer duck, the
dismal ventriloquous note of the rain-crow, or the splash of a dead
branch falling into the clear but lifeless bayou.</p>
<p>The pack of Cuban hounds that howl from Don Jos&eacute;'s
kennels cannot snuff the trail of the stolen canoe that glides
through the sombre blue vapors of the African's fastnesses. His
arrows send no telltale reverberations to the distant clearing.
Many a wretch in his native wilderness has Bras-Coup&eacute;
himself, in palmier days, driven to just such an existence, to
escape the chains and horrors of the barracoons; therefore not a
whit broods he over man's inhumanity, but, taking the affair as a
matter of course, casts about him for a future.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>THE STORY OF BRAS-COUP&Eacute;, CONTINUED</h3>
<br>
<p>Bras-Coup&eacute; let the autumn pass, and wintered in his
den.</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute;, in a majestic way, endeavored to be happy. He
took his se&ntilde;ora to his hall, and under her rule it took on
for a while a look and feeling which turned it from a hunting-lodge
into a home. Wherever the lady's steps turned--or it is as correct
to say wherever the proud tread of Palmyre turned--the features of
bachelor's-hall disappeared; guns, dogs, oars, saddles, nets, went
their way into proper banishment, and the broad halls and lofty
chambers--the floors now muffled with mats of palmetto-leaf--no
longer re-echoed the tread of a lonely master, but breathed a
redolence of flowers and a rippling murmur of well-contented
song.</p>
<p>But the song was not from the throat of Bras-Coup&eacute;'s
"<i>piti zozo</i>." Silent and severe by day, she moaned away whole
nights heaping reproaches upon herself for the impulse--now to her,
because it had failed, inexplicable in its folly--which had
permitted her hand to lie in Bras-Coup&eacute;'s and the priest to
bind them together.</p>
<p>For in the audacity of her pride, or, as Agricola would have
said, in the immensity of her impudence, she had held herself
consecrate to a hopeless love. But now she was a black man's wife!
and even he unable to sit at her feet and learn the lesson she had
hoped to teach him. She had heard of San Domingo; for months the
fierce heart within her silent bosom had been leaping and shouting
and seeing visions of fire and blood, and when she brooded over the
nearness of Agricola and the remoteness of Honor&eacute; these
visions got from her a sort of mad consent. The lesson she would
have taught the giant was Insurrection. But it was too late.
Letting her dagger sleep in her bosom, and with an undefined belief
in imaginary resources, she had consented to join hands with her
giant hero before the priest; and when the wedding had come and
gone like a white sail, she was seized with a lasting, fierce
despair. A wild aggressiveness that had formerly characterized her
glance in moments of anger--moments which had grown more and more
infrequent under the softening influence of her Mademoiselle's
nature--now came back intensified, and blazed in her eye
perpetually. Whatever her secret love may have been in kind, its
sinking beyond hope below the horizon had left her fifty times the
mutineer she had been before--the mutineer who has nothing to
lose.</p>
<p>"She loves her <i>candio</i>" said the negroes.</p>
<p>"Simple creatures!" said the overseer, who prided himself on his
discernment, "she loves nothing; she hates Agricola; it's a case of
hate at first sight--the strongest kind."</p>
<p>Both were partly right; her feelings were wonderfully knit to
the African; and she now dedicated herself to Agricola's ruin.</p>
<p>The se&ntilde;or, it has been said, endeavored to be happy; but
now his heart conceived and brought forth its first-born fear,
sired by superstition--the fear that he was bewitched. The negroes
said that Bras-Coup&eacute; had cursed the land. Morning after
morning the master looked out with apprehension toward the fields,
until one night the worm came upon the indigo, and between sunset
and sunrise every green leaf had been eaten up and there was
nothing left for either insect or apprehension to feed upon.</p>
<p>And then he said--and the echo came back from the Cannes
Brul&eacute;es--that the very bottom culpability of this thing
rested on the Grandissimes, and specifically on their fugleman
Agricola, through his putting the hellish African upon him.
Moreover, fever and death, to a degree unknown before, fell upon
his slaves. Those to whom life was spared--but to whom strength did
not return--wandered about the place like scarecrows, looking for
shelter, and made the very air dismal with the reiteration, "<i>No'
ouanga</i> (we are bewitched), <i>Bras-Coup&eacute; f&eacute; moi
des grigis</i> (the voudou's spells are on me)." The ripple of song
was hushed and the flowers fell upon the floor.</p>
<p>"I have heard an English maxim," wrote Colonel De Grapion to his
kinsman, "which I would recommend you to put into practice--'Fight
the devil with fire.'"</p>
<p>No, he would not recognize devils as belligerents.</p>
<p>But if Rome commissioned exorcists, could not he employ one?</p>
<p>No, he would not! If his hounds could not catch
Bras-Coup&eacute;, why, let him go. The overseer tried the hounds
once more and came home with the best one across his saddle-bow, an
arrow run half through its side.</p>
<p>Once the blacks attempted by certain familiar rum-pourings and
nocturnal charm-singing to lift the curse; but the moment the
master heard the wild monotone of their infernal worship, he
stopped it with a word.</p>
<p>Early in February came the spring, and with it some resurrection
of hope and courage. It may have been--it certainly was, in
part--because young Honor&eacute; Grandissime had returned. He was
like the sun's warmth wherever he went; and the other Honor&eacute;
was like his shadow. The fairer one quickly saw the meaning of
these things, hastened to cheer the young don with hopes of a
better future, and to effect, if he could, the restoration of
Bras-Coup&eacute; to his master's favor. But this latter effort was
an idle one. He had long sittings with his uncle Agricola to the
same end, but they always ended fruitless and often angrily.</p>
<p>His dark half-brother had seen Palmyre and loved her.
Honor&eacute; would gladly have solved one or two riddles by
effecting their honorable union in marriage. The previous ceremony
on the Grandissime back piazza need be no impediment; all
slave-owners understood those things. Following Honor&eacute;'s
advice, the f.m.c., who had come into possession of his paternal
portion, sent to Cannes Brul&eacute;es a written offer, to buy
Palmyre at any price that her master might name, stating his
intention to free her and make her his wife. Colonel De Grapion
could hardly hope to settle Palmyre's fate more satisfactorily, yet
he could not forego an opportunity to indulge his pride by
following up the threat he had hung over Agricola to kill whosoever
should give Palmyre to a black man. He referred the subject and the
would-be purchaser to him. It would open up to the old braggart a
line of retreat, thought the planter of the Cannes
Brul&eacute;es.</p>
<p>But the idea of retreat had left Citizen Fusilier.</p>
<p>"She is already married," said he to M. Honor&eacute;
Grandissime, f.m.c. "She is the lawful wife of Bras-Coup&eacute;;
and what God has joined together let no man put asunder. You know
it, sirrah. You did this for impudence, to make a show of your
wealth. You intended it as an insinuation of equality. I overlook
the impertinence for the sake of the man whose white blood you
carry; but h-mark you, if ever you bring your Parisian airs and
self-sufficient face on a level with mine again, h-I will slap
it."</p>
<p>The quadroon, three nights after, was so indiscreet as to give
him the opportunity, and he did it--at that quadroon ball to which
Dr. Keene alluded in talking to Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>But Don Jos&eacute;, we say, plucked up new spirit..</p>
<p>"Last year's disasters were but fortune's freaks," he said.
"See, others' crops have failed all about us."</p>
<p>The overseer shook his head.</p>
<p>"<i>C'est ce maudit cocodri' l&agrave; bas</i> (It is that
accursed alligator, Bras-Coup&eacute;, down yonder in the
swamp)."</p>
<p>And by and by the master was again smitten with the same belief.
He and his neighbors put in their crops afresh. The spring waned,
summer passed, the fevers returned, the year wore round, but no
harvest smiled. "Alas!" cried the planters, "we are all poor men!"
The worst among the worst were the fields of Bras-Coup&eacute;'s
master--parched and shrivelled. "He does not understand planting,"
said his neighbors; "neither does his overseer. Maybe, too, it is
true as he says, that he is voudoued."</p>
<p>One day at high noon the master was taken sick with fever.</p>
<p>The third noon after--the sad wife sitting by the
bedside--suddenly, right in the centre of the room, with the door
open behind him, stood the magnificent, half-nude form of
Bras-Coup&eacute;. He did not fall down as the mistress's eyes met
his, though all his flesh quivered. The master was lying with his
eyes closed. The fever had done a fearful three days' work.</p>
<p>"<i>Mioko-Koanga oul&eacute; so' femme</i> (Bras-Coup&eacute;
wants his wife)."</p>
<p>The master started wildly and stared upon his slave.</p>
<p>"<i>Bras-Coup&eacute; oul&eacute; so' femme</i>!" repeated the
black.</p>
<p>"Seize him!" cried the sick man, trying to rise.</p>
<p>But, though several servants had ventured in with frightened
faces, none dared molest the giant. The master turned his
entreating eyes upon his wife, but she seemed stunned, and only
covered her face with her hands and sat as if paralyzed by a
foreknowledge of what was coming.</p>
<p>Bras-Coup&eacute; lifted his great black palm and commenced:</p>
<p>"<i>Mo c&eacute; voudrai que la maison ci l&agrave;, et tout
&ccedil;a qui pas femme' ici, s'raient encore maudits</i>! (May
this house, and all in it who are not women, be accursed)."</p>
<p>The master fell back upon his pillow with a groan of helpless
wrath.</p>
<p>The African pointed his finger through the open window.</p>
<p>"May its fields not know the plough nor nourish the herds that
overrun it."</p>
<p>The domestics, who had thus far stood their ground, suddenly
rushed from the room like stampeded cattle, and at that moment
appeared Palmyre.</p>
<p>"Speak to him," faintly cried the panting invalid.</p>
<p>She went firmly up to her husband and lifted her hand. With an
easy motion, but quick as lightning, as a lion sets foot on a dog,
he caught her by the arm.</p>
<p>"<i>Bras-Coup&eacute; oul&eacute; so' femme</i>," he said, and
just then Palmyre would have gone with him to the equator.</p>
<p>"You shall not have her!" gasped the master.</p>
<p>The African seemed to rise in height, and still holding his wife
at arm's length, resumed his malediction:</p>
<p>"May weeds cover the ground until the air is full of their odor
and the wild beasts of the forest come and lie down under their
cover."</p>
<p>With a frantic effort the master lifted himself upon his elbow
and extended his clenched fist in speechless defiance; but his
brain reeled, his sight went out, and when again he saw, Palmyre
and her mistress were bending over him, the overseer stood
awkwardly by, and Bras-Coup&eacute; was gone.</p>
<p>The plantation became an invalid camp. The words of the voudou
found fulfilment on every side. The plough went not out; the herds
wandered through broken hedges from field to field and came up with
staring bones and shrunken sides; a frenzied mob of weeds and
thorns wrestled and throttled each other in a struggle for
standing-room--rag-weed, smart-weed, sneeze-weed, bindweed,
iron-weed--until the burning skies of midsummer checked their
growth and crowned their unshorn tops with rank and dingy
flowers.</p>
<p>"Why in the name of--St. Francis," asked the priest of the
overseer, "didn't the se&ntilde;ora use her power over the black
scoundrel when he stood and cursed, that day?"</p>
<p>"Why, to tell you the truth, father," said the overseer, in a
discreet whisper, "I can only suppose she thought Bras-Coup&eacute;
had half a right to do it."</p>
<p>"Ah, ah, I see; like her brother Honor&eacute;--looks at both
sides of a question--a miserable practice; but why couldn't Palmyre
use <i>her</i> eyes? They would have stopped him."</p>
<p>"Palmyre? Why Palmyre has become the best <i>monture</i>
(Plutonian medium) in the parish. Agricola Fusilier himself is
afraid of her. Sir, I think sometimes Bras-Coup&eacute; is dead and
his spirit has gone into Palmyre. She would rather add to his curse
than take from it."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the jovial divine, with a fat smile, "castigation
would help her case; the whip is a great sanctifier. I fancy it
would even make a Christian of the inexpugnable
Bras-Coup&eacute;."</p>
<p>But Bras-Coup&eacute; kept beyond the reach alike of the lash
and of the Latin Bible.</p>
<p>By and by came a man with a rumor, whom the overseer brought to
the master's sick-room, to tell that an enterprising Frenchman was
attempting to produce a new staple in Louisiana, one that worms
would not annihilate. It was that year of history when the
despairing planters saw ruin hovering so close over them that they
cried to heaven for succor. Providence raised up &Eacute;tienne de
Bor&eacute;. "And if &Eacute;tienne is successful," cried the
news-bearer, "and gets the juice of the sugar-cane to crystallize,
so shall all of us, after him, and shall yet save our lands and
homes. Oh, Se&ntilde;or, it will make you strong again to see these
fields all cane and the long rows of negroes and negresses cutting
it, while they sing their song of those droll African numerals,
counting the canes they cut," and the bearer of good tidings sang
them for very joy:</p>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/282.png" width="100%" alt=""></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>"And Honor&eacute; Grandissime is going to introduce it on his
lands," said Don Jos&eacute;.</p>
<p>"That is true," said Agricola Fusilier, coming in.
Honor&eacute;, the indefatigable peacemaker, had brought his uncle
and his brother-in-law for the moment not only to speaking, but to
friendly, terms.</p>
<p>The se&ntilde;or smiled.</p>
<p>"I have some good tidings, too," he said; "my beloved lady has
borne me a son."</p>
<p>"Another scion of the house of Grand--I mean Martinez!"
exclaimed Agricola. "And now, Don Jos&eacute;, let me say that
<i>I</i> have an item of rare intelligence!"</p>
<p>The don lifted his feeble head and opened his inquiring eyes
with a sudden, savage light in them.</p>
<p>"No," said Agricola, "he is not exactly taken yet, but they are
on his track."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"The police. We may say he is virtually in our grasp."</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>It was on a Sabbath afternoon that a band of Choctaws having
just played a game of racquette behind the city and a similar game
being about to end between the white champions of two rival
faubourgs, the beating of tom-toms, rattling of mules' jawbones and
sounding of wooden horns drew the populace across the fields to a
spot whose present name of Congo Square still preserves a reminder
of its old barbaric pastimes. On a grassy plain under the ramparts,
the performers of these hideous discords sat upon the ground facing
each other, and in their midst the dancers danced. They gyrated in
couples, a few at a time, throwing their bodies into the most
startling attitudes and the wildest contortions, while the whole
company of black lookers-on, incited by the tones of the weird
music and the violent posturing of the dancers, swayed and writhed
in passionate sympathy, beating their breasts, palms and thighs in
time with the bones and drums, and at frequent intervals lifting,
in that wild African unison no more to be described than forgotten,
the unutterable songs of the Babouille and Counjaille dances, with
their ejaculatory burdens of "<i>Aie! Aie! Voudou Magnan!</i>" and
"<i>Aie Calinda! Danc&eacute; Calinda!</i>" The volume of sound
rose and fell with the augmentation or diminution of the dancers'
extravagances. Now a fresh man, young and supple, bounding into the
ring, revived the flagging rattlers, drummers and trumpeters; now a
wearied dancer, finding his strength going, gathered all his force
at the cry of "<i>Danc&eacute; zisqu'a mort!</i>" rallied to a
grand finale and with one magnificent antic fell, foaming at the
mouth.</p>
<p>The amusement had reached its height. Many participants had been
lugged out by the neck to avoid their being danced on, and the
enthusiasm had risen to a frenzy, when there bounded into the ring
the blackest of black men, an athlete of superb figure, in breeches
of "Indienne"--the stuff used for slave women's best
dresses--jingling with bells, his feet in moccasins, his tight,
crisp hair decked out with feathers, a necklace of alligator's
teeth rattling on his breast and a living serpent twined about his
neck.</p>
<p>It chanced that but one couple was dancing. Whether they had
been sent there by advice of Agricola is not certain. Snatching a
tambourine from a bystander as he entered, the stranger thrust the
male dancer aside, faced the woman and began a series of
saturnalian antics, compared with which all that had gone before
was tame and sluggish; and as he finally leaped, with tinkling
heels, clean over his bewildered partner's head, the multitude
howled with rapture.</p>
<p>Ill-starred Bras-Coup&eacute;. He was in that extra-hazardous
and irresponsible condition of mind and body known in the
undignified present as "drunk again."</p>
<p>By the strangest fortune, if not, as we have just hinted, by
some design, the man whom he had once deposited in the willow
bushes, and the woman Clemence, were the very two dancers, and no
other, whom he had interrupted. The man first stupidly regarded,
next admiringly gazed upon, and then distinctly recognized, his
whilom driver. Five minutes later the Spanish police were putting
their heads together to devise a quick and permanent capture; and
in the midst of the sixth minute, as the wonderful fellow was
rising in a yet more astounding leap than his last, a lasso fell
about his neck and brought him, crashing like a burnt tree, face
upward upon the turf.</p>
<p>"The runaway slave," said the old French code, continued in
force by the Spaniards, "the runaway slave who shall continue to be
so for one month from the day of his being denounced to the
officers of justice shall have his ears cut off and shall be
branded with the flower de luce on the shoulder; and on a second
offence of the same nature, persisted in during one month of his
being denounced, he shall be hamstrung, and be marked with the
flower de luce on the other shoulder. On the third offence he shall
die." Bras-Coup&eacute; had run away only twice. "But," said
Agricola, "these 'bossals' must be taught their place. Besides,
there is Article 27 of the same code: 'The slave who, having struck
his master, shall have produced a bruise, shall suffer capital
punishment'--a very necessary law!" He concluded with a scowl upon
Palmyre, who shot back a glance which he never forgot.</p>
<p>The Spaniard showed himself very merciful--for a Spaniard; he
spared the captive's life. He might have been more merciful still;
but Honor&eacute; Grandissime said some indignant things in the
African's favor, and as much to teach the Grandissimes a lesson as
to punish the runaway, he would have repented his clemency, as he
repented the momentary truce with Agricola, but for the tearful
pleading of the se&ntilde;ora and the hot, dry eyes of her maid.
Because of these he overlooked the offence against his person and
estate, and delivered Bras-Coup&eacute; to the law to suffer only
the penalties of the crime he had committed against society by
attempting to be a free man.</p>
<p>We repeat it for the credit of Palmyre, that she pleaded for
Bras-Coup&eacute;. But what it cost her to make that intercession,
knowing that his death would leave her free, and that if he lived
she must be his wife, let us not attempt to say.</p>
<p>In the midst of the ancient town, in a part which is now
crumbling away, stood the Calaboza, with its humid vaults and
grated cells, its iron cages and its whips; and there, soon enough,
they strapped Bras-Coup&eacute; face downward and laid on the lash.
And yet not a sound came from the mutilated but unconquered African
to annoy the ear of the sleeping city.</p>
<p>("And you suffered this thing to take place?" asked Joseph
Frowenfeld of Honor&eacute; Grandissime.</p>
<p>"My-de'-seh!" exclaimed the Creole, "they lied to me--said they
would not harm him!")</p>
<p>He was brought at sunrise to the plantation. The air was sweet
with the smell of the weed-grown fields. The long-horned oxen that
drew him and the naked boy that drove the team stopped before his
cabin.</p>
<p>"You cannot put that creature in there," said the thoughtful
overseer. "He would suffocate under a roof--he has been too long
out-of-doors for that. Put him on my cottage porch." There, at
last, Palmyre burst into tears and sank down, while before her, on
a soft bed of dry grass, rested the helpless form of the captive
giant, a cloth thrown over his galled back, his ears shorn from his
head, and the tendons behind his knees severed. His eyes were dry,
but there was in them that unspeakable despair that fills the eye
of the charger when, fallen in battle, he gazes with
sidewise-bended neck on the ruin wrought upon him. His eye turned
sometimes slowly to his wife. He need not demand her now--she was
always by him.</p>
<p>There was much talk over him--much idle talk. He merely lay
still under it with a fixed frown; but once some incautious tongue
dropped the name of Agricola. The black man's eyes came so quickly
round to Palmyre that she thought he would speak; but no; his words
were all in his eyes. She answered their gleam with a fierce
affirmative glance, whereupon he slowly bent his head and spat upon
the floor.</p>
<p>There was yet one more trial of his wild nature. The mandate
came from his master's sick-bed that he must lift the curse.</p>
<p>Bras-Coup&eacute; merely smiled. God keep thy enemy from such a
smile!</p>
<p>The overseer, with a policy less Spanish than his master's,
endeavored to use persuasion. But the fallen prince would not so
much as turn one glance from his parted hamstrings. Palmyre was
then besought to intercede. She made one poor attempt, but her
husband was nearer doing her an unkindness than ever he had been
before; he made a slow sign for silence--with his fist; and every
mouth was stopped.</p>
<p>At midnight following, there came, on the breeze that blew from
the mansion, a sound of running here and there, of wailing and
sobbing--another Bridegroom was coming, and the Spaniard, with much
such a lamp in hand as most of us shall be found with, neither
burning brightly nor wholly gone out, went forth to meet Him.</p>
<p>"Bras-Coup&eacute;," said Palmyre, next evening, speaking low in
his mangled ear, "the master is dead; he is just buried. As he was
dying, Bras-Coup&eacute;, he asked that you would forgive him."</p>
<p>The maimed man looked steadfastly at his wife. He had not spoken
since the lash struck him, and he spoke not now; but in those
large, clear eyes, where his remaining strength seemed to have
taken refuge as in a citadel, the old fierceness flared up for a
moment, and then, like an expiring beacon, went out.</p>
<p>"Is your mistress well enough by this time to venture here?"
whispered the overseer to Palmyre. "Let her come. Tell her not to
fear, but to bring the babe--in her own arms, tell
her--quickly!"</p>
<p>The lady came, her infant boy in her arms, knelt down beside the
bed of sweet grass and set the child within the hollow of the
African's arm. Bras-Coup&eacute; turned his gaze upon it; it
smiled, its mother's smile, and put its hand upon the runaway's
face, and the first tears of Bras-Coup&eacute;'s life, the dying
testimony of his humanity, gushed from his eyes and rolled down his
cheek upon the infant's hand. He laid his own tenderly upon the
babe's forehead, then removing it, waved it abroad, inaudibly moved
his lips, dropped his arm, and closed his eyes. The curse was
lifted.</p>
<p>"<i>Le pauv' dgiab'</i>!" said the overseer, wiping his eyes and
looking fieldward. "Palmyre, you must get the priest."</p>
<p>The priest came, in the identical gown in which he had appeared
the night of the two weddings. To the good father's many tender
questions Bras-Coup&eacute; turned a failing eye that gave no
answers; until, at length:</p>
<p>"Do you know where you are going?" asked the holy man.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered his eyes, brightening.</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>He did not reply; he was lost in contemplation, and seemed
looking far away.</p>
<p>So the question was repeated.</p>
<p>"Do you know where you are going?"</p>
<p>And again the answer of the eyes. He knew.</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>The overseer at the edge of the porch, the widow with her babe,
and Palmyre and the priest bending over the dying bed, turned an
eager ear to catch the answer.</p>
<p>"To--" the voice failed a moment; the departing hero essayed
again; again it failed; he tried once more, lifted his hand, and
with an ecstatic, upward smile, whispered, "To--Africa"--and was
gone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>PARALYSIS</h3>
<br>
<p>As we have said, the story of Bras-Coup&eacute; was told that
day three times: to the Grandissime beauties once, to Frowenfeld
twice. The fair Grandissimes all agreed, at the close; that it was
pitiful. Specially, that it was a great pity to have hamstrung
Bras-Coup&eacute;, a man who even in his cursing had made an
exception in favor of the ladies. True, they could suggest no
alternative; it was undeniable that he had deserved his fate;
still, it seemed a pity. They dispersed, retired and went to sleep
confirmed in this sentiment. In Frowenfeld the story stirred deeper
feelings.</p>
<p>On this same day, while it was still early morning,
Honor&eacute; Grandissime, f.m.c., with more than even his wonted
slowness of step and propriety of rich attire, had reappeared in
the shop of the rue Royale. He did not need to say he desired
another private interview. Frowenfeld ushered him silently and at
once into his rear room, offered him a chair (which he accepted),
and sat down before him.</p>
<p>In his labored way the quadroon stated his knowledge that
Frowenfeld had been three times to the dwelling of Palmyre
Philosophe. Why, he further intimated, he knew not, nor would he
ask; but <i>he</i>--when <i>he</i> had applied for admission--had
been refused. He had laid open his heart to the apothecary's
eyes--"It may have been unwisely--"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld interrupted him; Palmyre had been ill for several
days; Doctor Keene--who, Mr. Grandissime probably knew, was her
physician--</p>
<p>The landlord bowed, and Frowenfeld went on to explain that
Doctor Keene, while attending her, had also fallen sick and had
asked him to take the care of this one case until he could himself
resume it. So there, in a word, was the reason why Joseph had, and
others had not, been admitted to her presence.</p>
<p>As obviously to the apothecary's eyes as anything intangible
could be, a load of suffering was lifted from the quadroon's mind,
as this explanation was concluded. Yet he only sat in meditation
before his tenant, who regarded him long and sadly. Then, seized
with one of his energetic impulses, he suddenly said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Grandissime, you are a man of intelligence,
accomplishments, leisure and wealth; why" (clenchings his fists and
frowning), "why do you not give yourself--your
time--wealth--attainments--energies--everything--to the cause of
the downtrodden race with which this community's scorn unjustly
compels you to rank yourself?"</p>
<p>The quadroon did not meet Frowenfeld's kindled eyes for a
moment, and when he did, it was slowly and dejectedly.</p>
<p>"He canno' be," he said, and then, seeing his words were not
understood, he added: "He 'ave no Cause. Dad peop' 'ave no Cause."
He went on from this with many pauses and gropings after words and
idiom, to tell, with a plaintiveness that seemed to Frowenfeld
almost unmanly, the reasons why the people, a little of whose blood
had been enough to blast his life, would never be free by the force
of their own arm. Reduced to the meanings which he vainly tried to
convey in words, his statement was this: that that people was not a
people. Their cause--was in Africa. They upheld it there--they lost
it there--and to those that are here the struggle was over; they
were, one and all, prisoners of war.</p>
<p>"You speak of them in the third person," said Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"Ah ham nod a slev."</p>
<p>"Are you certain of that?" asked the tenant.</p>
<p>His landlord looked at him.</p>
<p>"It seems to me," said Frowenfeld, "that you--your class--the
free quadroons--are the saddest slaves of all. Your men, for a
little property, and your women, for a little amorous attention,
let themselves be shorn even of the virtue of discontent, and for a
paltry bait of sham freedom have consented to endure a tyrannous
contumely which flattens them into the dirt like grass under a
slab. I would rather be a runaway in the swamps than content myself
with such a freedom. As your class stands before the world
to-day--free in form but slaves in spirit--you are--I do not know
but I was almost ready to say--a warning to philanthropists!"</p>
<p>The free man of color slowly arose.</p>
<p>"I trust you know," said Frowenfeld, "that I say nothing in
offence."</p>
<p>"Havery word is tru'," replied the sad man.</p>
<p>"Mr. Grandissime," said the apothecary, as his landlord sank
back again into his seat, "I know you are a broken-hearted
man."</p>
<p>The quadroon laid his fist upon his heart and looked up.</p>
<p>"And being broken-hearted, you are thus specially fitted for a
work of patient and sustained self-sacrifice. You have only those
things to lose which grief has taught you to despise--ease, money,
display. Give yourself to your people--to those, I mean, who groan,
or should groan, under the degraded lot which is theirs and yours
in common."</p>
<p>The quadroon shook his head, and after a moment's silence,
answered:</p>
<p>"Ah cannod be one Toussaint l'Ouverture. Ah cannod trah to be.
Hiv I trah, I h-only s'all soogceed to be one
Bras-Coup&eacute;."</p>
<p>"You entirely misunderstand me," said Frowenfeld in quick
response. "I have no stronger disbelief than my disbelief in
insurrection. I believe that to every desirable end there are two
roads, the way of strife and the way of peace. I can imagine a man
in your place, going about among his people, stirring up their
minds to a noble discontent, laying out his means, sparingly here
and bountifully there, as in each case might seem wisest, for their
enlightenment, their moral elevation, their training in skilled
work; going, too, among the men of the prouder caste, among such as
have a spirit of fairness, and seeking to prevail with them for a
public recognition of the rights of all; using all his cunning to
show them the double damage of all oppression, both great and
petty--"</p>
<p>The quadroon motioned "enough." There was a heat in his eyes
which Frowenfeld had never seen before.</p>
<p>"M'sieu'," he said, "waid till Agricola Fusilier ees keel."</p>
<p>"Do you mean 'dies'?"</p>
<p>"No," insisted the quadroon; "listen." And with slow,
painstaking phrase this man of strong feeling and feeble will (the
trait of his caste) told--as Frowenfeld felt he would do the moment
he said "listen"--such part of the story of Bras-Coup&eacute; as
showed how he came by his deadly hatred of Agricola.</p>
<p>"Tale me," said the landlord, as he concluded the recital, "w'y
deen Bras Coup&eacute; mague dad curze on Agricola Fusilier? Becoze
Agricola ees one sorcier! Elz 'e bin dade sinz long tamm."</p>
<p>The speaker's gestures seemed to imply that his own hand, if
need be, would have brought the event to pass.</p>
<p>As he rose to say adieu, Frowenfeld, without previous intention,
laid a hand upon his visitor's arm.</p>
<p>"Is there no one who can make peace between you?"</p>
<p>The landlord shook his head.</p>
<p>"'Tis impossib'. We don' wand."</p>
<p>"I mean," insisted Frowenfeld, "Is there no man who can stand
between you and those who wrong you, and effect a peaceful
reparation?"</p>
<p>The landlord slowly moved away, neither he nor his tenant
speaking, but each knowing that the one man in the minds of both,
as a possible peacemaker, was Honor&eacute; Grandissime.</p>
<p>"Should the opportunity offer," continued Joseph, "may I speak a
word for you myself?"</p>
<p>The quadroon paused a moment, smiled politely though bitterly,
and departed repeating again:</p>
<p>"'Tis impossib'. We don' wand."</p>
<p>"Palsied," murmured Frowenfeld, looking after him,
regretfully,--"like all of them."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's thoughts were still on the same theme when, the day
having passed, the hour was approaching wherein Innerarity was
exhorted to tell his good-night story in the merry circle at the
distant Grandissime mansion. As the apothecary was closing his last
door for the night, the fairer Honor&eacute; called him out into
the moonlight.</p>
<p>"Withered," the student was saying audibly to himself, "not in
the shadow of the Ethiopian, but in the glare of the white
man."</p>
<p>"Who is withered?" pleasantly demanded Honor&eacute;. The
apothecary started slightly.</p>
<p>"Did I speak? How do you do, sir? I meant the free
quadroons."</p>
<p>"Including the gentleman from whom you rent your store?"</p>
<p>"Yes, him especially; he told me this morning the story of
Bras-Coup&eacute;."</p>
<p>M. Grandissime laughed. Joseph did not see why, nor did the
laugh sound entirely genuine.</p>
<p>"Do not open the door, Mr Frowenfeld," said the Creole, "Get
your greatcoat and cane and come take a walk with me; I will tell
you the same story."</p>
<p>It was two hours before they approached this door again on their
return. Just before they reached it, Honor&eacute; stopped under
the huge street-lamp, whose light had gone out, where a large stone
lay before him on the ground in the narrow, moonlit street. There
was a tall, unfinished building at his back.</p>
<p>"Mr Frowenfeld,"--he struck the stone with his cane,--"this
stone is Bras-Coup&eacute;--we cast it aside because it turns the
edge of our tools."</p>
<p>He laughed. He had laughed to-night more than was comfortable to
a man of Frowenfeld's quiet mind.</p>
<p>As the apothecary thrust his shopkey into the lock and so paused
to hear his companion, who had begun again to speak, he wondered
what it could be--for M. Grandissime had not disclosed it--that
induced such a man as he to roam aimlessly, as it seemed, in
deserted streets at such chill and dangerous hours. "What does he
want with me?" The thought was so natural that it was no miracle
the Creole read it.</p>
<p>"Well," said he, smiling and taking an attitude, "you are a
great man for causes, Mr. Frowenfeld; but me, I am for results, ha,
ha! You may ponder the philosophy of Bras-Coup&eacute; in your
study, but <i>I</i> have got to get rid of his results, me. You
know them."</p>
<p>"You tell me it revived a war where you had made a peace," said
Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"Yes--yes--that is his results; but good night, Mr.
Frowenfeld."</p>
<p>"Good night, sir."</p>

<h3>ANOTHER WOUND IN A NEW PLACE</h3>
<br>
<p>Each day found Doctor Keene's strength increasing, and on the
morning following the incidents last recorded he was imprudently
projecting an outdoor promenade. An announcement from Honor&eacute;
Grandissime, who had paid an early call, had, to that gentleman's
no small surprise, produced a sudden and violent effect on the
little man's temper.</p>
<p>He was sitting alone by his window, looking out upon the levee,
when the apothecary entered the apartment.</p>
<p>"Frowenfeld," he instantly began, with evident displeasure most
unaccountable to Joseph, "I hear you have been visiting the
Nancanous."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have been there."</p>
<p>"Well, you had no business to go!"</p>
<p>Doctor Keene smote the arm of his chair with his fist.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld reddened with indignation, but suppressed his retort.
He stood still in the middle of the floor, and Doctor Keene looked
out of the window.</p>
<p>"Doctor Keene," said the visitor, when his attitude was no
longer tolerable, "have you anything more to say to me before I
leave you?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"It is necessary for me, then, to say that in fulfilment of my
promise, I am going from here to the house of Palmyre, and that she
will need no further attention after to-day. As to your present
manner toward me, I shall endeavor to suspend judgment until I have
some knowledge of its cause."</p>
<p>The doctor made no reply, but went on looking out of the window,
and Frowenfeld turned and left him.</p>
<p>As he arrived in the philosophe's sick-chamber--where he found
her sitting in a chair set well back from a small fire--she
half-whispered "Mich&eacute;" with a fine, greeting smile, as if to
a brother after a week's absence. To a person forced to lie abed,
shut away from occupation and events, a day is ten, three are a
month: not merely in the wear and tear upon the patience, but also
in the amount of thinking and recollecting done. It was to be
expected, then, that on this, the apothecary's fourth visit,
Palmyre would have learned to take pleasure in his coming.</p>
<p>But the smile was followed by a faint, momentary frown, as if
Frowenfeld had hardly returned it in kind. Likely enough, he had
not. He was not distinctively a man of smiles; and as he engaged in
his appointed task she presently thought of this.</p>
<p>"This wound is doing so well," said Joseph, still engaged with
the bandages, "that I shall not need to come again." He was not
looking at her as he spoke, but he felt her give a sudden start.
"What is this?" he thought, but presently said very quietly: "With
the assistance of your slave woman, you can now attend to it
yourself."</p>
<p>She made no answer.</p>
<p>When, with a bow, he would have bade her good morning, she held
out her hand for his. After a barely perceptible hesitation, he
gave it, whereupon she held it fast, in a way to indicate that
there was something to be said which he must stay and hear.</p>
<p>She looked up into his face. She may have been merely framing in
her mind the word or two of English she was about to utter; but an
excitement shone through her eyes and reddened her lips, and
something sent out from her countenance a look of wild
distress.</p>
<p>"You goin' tell 'im?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Who? Agricola?"</p>
<p>"<i>Non</i>!"</p>
<p>He spoke the next name more softly.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;?"</p>
<p>Her eyes looked deeply into his for a moment, then dropped, and
she made a sign of assent.</p>
<p>He was about to say that Honor&eacute; knew already, but saw no
necessity for doing so, and changed his answer.</p>
<p>"I will never tell any one."</p>
<p>"You know?" she asked, lifting her eyes for an instant. She
meant to ask if he knew the motive that had prompted her murderous
intent.</p>
<p>"I know your whole sad history."</p>
<p>She looked at him for a moment, fixedly; then, still holding his
hand with one of hers, she threw the other to her face and turned
away her head. He thought she moaned.</p>
<p>Thus she remained for a few moments, then suddenly she turned,
clasped both hands about his, her face flamed up and she opened her
lips to speak, but speech failed. An expression of pain and
supplication came upon her countenance, and the cry burst from
her:</p>
<p>"Meg 'im to love me!"</p>
<p>He tried to withdraw his hand, but she held it fast, and,
looking up imploringly with her wide, electric eyes, cried:</p>
<p>"<i>Vous pouvez le faire, vous pouvez le faire</i> (You can do
it, you can do it); <i>vous &ecirc;tes sorcier, mo conn&eacute;
bien vous &ecirc;tes sorcier</i> (you are a sorcerer, I know)."</p>
<p>However harmless or healthful Joseph's touch might be to the
philosophe, he felt now that hers, to him, was poisonous. He dared
encounter her eyes, her touch, her voice, no longer. The better man
in him was suffocating. He scarce had power left to liberate his
right hand with his left, to seize his hat and go.</p>
<p>Instantly she rose from her chair, threw herself on her knees in
his path, and found command of his language sufficient to cry as
she lifted her arms, bared of their drapery:</p>
<p>"Oh, my God! don' rif-used me--don' rif-used me!"</p>
<p>There was no time to know whether Frowenfeld wavered or not. The
thought flashed into his mind that in all probability all the care
and skill he had spent upon the wound was being brought to naught
in this moment of wild posturing and excitement; but before it
could have effect upon his movements, a stunning blow fell upon the
back of his head, and Palmyre's slave woman, the Congo dwarf, under
the impression that it was the most timely of strokes, stood
brandishing a billet of pine and preparing to repeat the blow.</p>
<p>He hurled her, snarling and gnashing like an ape, against the
farther wall, cast the bar from the street door and plunged out,
hatless, bleeding and stunned.</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>INTERRUPTED PRELIMINARIES</h3>
<br>
<p>About the same time of day, three gentlemen (we use the term
gentlemen in its petrified state) were walking down the rue Royale
from the direction of the Faubourg Ste. Marie.</p>
<p>They were coming down toward Palmyre's corner. The middle one,
tall and shapely, might have been mistaken at first glance for
Honor&eacute; Grandissime, but was taller and broader, and wore a
cocked hat, which Honor&eacute; did not. It was Valentine. The
short, black-bearded man in buckskin breeches on his right was
Jean-Baptiste Grandissime, and the slight one on the left, who,
with the prettiest and most graceful gestures and balancings, was
leading the conversation, was Hippolyte Brahmin-Mandarin, a cousin
and counterpart of that sturdy-hearted challenger of Agricola,
Sylvestre.</p>
<p>"But after all," he was saying in Louisiana French, "there is no
spot comparable, for comfortable seclusion, to the old orange grove
under the levee on the Point; twenty minutes in a skiff, five
minutes for preliminaries--you would not want more, the ground has
been measured off five hundred times--'are you ready?'--"</p>
<p>"Ah, bah!" said Valentine, tossing his head, "the Yankees would
be down on us before you could count one."</p>
<p>"Well, then, behind the Jesuits' warehouses, if you insist. I
don't care. Perdition take such a government! I am almost sorry I
went to the governor's reception."</p>
<p>"It was quiet, I hear; a sort of quiet ball, all promenading and
no contra-dances. One quadroon ball is worth five of such."</p>
<p>This was the opinion of Jean-Baptiste.</p>
<p>"No, it was fine, anyhow. There was a contra-dance. The music
was--t&aacute;rata joonc, tar&aacute;, tar&aacute;--t&aacute;rata
joonc, tar&aacute;rata joonc, tar&aacute;--oh! it was the finest
thing--and composed here. They compose as fine things here as they
do anywhere in the--look there! That man came out of Palmyre's
house; see how he staggered just then!"</p>
<p>"Drunk," said Jean-Baptiste.</p>
<p>"No, he seems to be hurt. He has been struck on the head. Oho, I
tell you, gentlemen, that same Palmyre is a wonderful animal! Do
you see? She not only defends herself and ejects the wretch, but
she puts her mark upon him; she identifies him, ha, ha, ha! Look at
the high art of the thing; she keeps his hat as a small souvenir
and gives him a receipt for it on the back of his head. Ah! but
hasn't she taught him a lesson? Why, gentlemen,--it is--if it isn't
that sorcerer of an apothecary!"</p>
<p>"What?" exclaimed the other two; "well, well, but this is too
good! Caught at last, ha, ha, ha, the saintly villain! Ah, ha, ha!
Will not Honor&eacute; be proud of him now? <i>Ah! voil&agrave; un
joli Joseph!</i> What did I tell you? Didn't I <i>always</i> tell
you so?"</p>
<p>"But the beauty of it is, he is caught so cleverly. No
escape--no possible explanation. There he is, gentlemen, as plain
as a rat in a barrel, and with as plain a case. Ha, ha, ha! Isn't
it just glorious?"</p>
<p>And all three laughed in such an ecstasy of glee that Frowenfeld
looked back, saw them, and knew forthwith that his good name was
gone. The three gentlemen, with tears of merriment still in their
eyes, reached a corner and disappeared.</p>
<p>"Mister," said a child, trotting along under Frowenfeld's
elbow,--the odd English of the New Orleans street-urchin was at
that day just beginning to be heard--"Mister, dey got some blood on
de back of you' hade!"</p>
<p>But Frowenfeld hurried on groaning with mental anguish.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL</h3>
<br>
<p>It was the year 1804. The world was trembling under the tread of
the dread Corsican. It was but now that he had tossed away the
whole Valley of the Mississippi, dropping it overboard as a little
sand from a balloon, and Christendom in a pale agony of suspense
was watching the turn of his eye; yet when a gibbering black fool
here on the edge of civilization merely swings a pine-knot, the
swinging of that pine-knot becomes to Joseph Frowenfeld, student of
man, a matter of greater moment than the destination of the
Boulogne Flotilla. For it now became for the moment the foremost
necessity of his life to show, to that minute fraction of the
earth's population which our terror misnames "the world," that a
man may leap forth hatless and bleeding from the house of a New
Orleans quadroon into the open street and yet be pure white within.
Would it answer to tell the truth? Parts of that truth he was
pledged not to tell; and even if he could tell it all it was
incredible--bore all the features of a flimsy lie.</p>
<p>"Mister," repeated the same child who had spoken before,
reinforced by another under the other elbow, "dey got some
<i>blood</i> on de back of you' hade."</p>
<p>And the other added the suggestion:</p>
<p>"Dey got one drug-sto', yondah."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld groaned again. The knock had been a hard one, the
ground and sky went round not a little, but he retained withal a
white-hot process of thought that kept before him his hopeless
inability to explain. He was coffined alive. The world (so-called)
would bury him in utter loathing, and write on his headstone the
one word--hypocrite. And he should lie there and helplessly
contemplate Honor&eacute; pushing forward those purposes which he
had begun to hope he was to have had the honor of furthering. But
instead of so doing he would now be the by-word of the street.</p>
<p>"Mister," interposed the child once more, spokesman this time
for a dozen blacks and whites of all sizes trailing along before
and behind, "<i>dey got some blood</i> on de back of you'
<i>hade</i>."</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>That same morning Clotilde had given a music-scholar her
appointed lesson, and at its conclusion had borrowed of her
patroness (how pleasant it must have been to have such things to
lend!) a little yellow maid, in order that, with more propriety,
she might make a business call. It was that matter of the rent--one
that had of late occasioned her great secret distress. "It is
plain," she had begun to say to herself, unable to comprehend
Aurora's peculiar trust in Providence, "that if the money is to be
got I must get it." A possibility had flashed upon her mind; she
had nurtured it into a project, had submitted it to her
father-confessor in the cathedral, and received his unqualified
approval of it, and was ready this morning to put it into
execution. A great merit of the plan was its simplicity. It was
merely to find for her heaviest bracelet a purchaser in time, and a
price sufficient, to pay to-morrow's "maturities." See there
again!--to her, her little secret was of greater import than the
collision of almost any pine-knot with almost any head.</p>
<p>It must not be accepted as evidence either of her unwillingness
to sell or of the amount of gold in the bracelet, that it took the
total of Clotilde's moral and physical strength to carry it to the
shop where she hoped--against hope--to dispose of it.</p>
<p>'Sieur Frowenfeld, M. Innerarity said, was out, but would
certainly be in in a few minutes, and she was persuaded to take a
chair against the half-hidden door at the bottom of the shop with
the little borrowed maid crouched at her feet.</p>
<p>She had twice or thrice felt a regret that she had undertaken to
wait, and was about to rise and go, when suddenly she saw before
her Joseph Frowenfeld, wiping the sweat of anguish from his brow
and smeared with blood from his forehead down. She rose quickly and
silently, turned sick and blind, and laid her hand upon the back of
the chair for support. Frowenfeld stood an instant before her,
groaned, and disappeared through the door. The little maid,
retreating backward against her from the direction of the
street-door, drew to her attention a crowd of sight-seers which had
rushed up to the doors and against which Raoul was hurriedly
closing the shop.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>CLOTILDE AS A SURGEON</h3>
<br>
<p>Was it worse to stay, or to fly? The decision must be
instantaneous. But Raoul made it easy by crying in their common
tongue, as he slammed a massive shutter and shot its bolt:</p>
<p>"Go to him! he is down--I heard him fall. Go to him!"</p>
<p>At this rallying cry she seized her shield--that is to say, the
little yellow attendant--and hurried into the room. Joseph lay just
beyond the middle of the apartment, face downward. She found water
and a basin, wet her own handkerchief, and dropped to her knees
beside his head; but the moment he felt the small feminine hands he
stood up. She took him by the arm.</p>
<p>"<i>Asseyez-vous, Monsieu'</i>--pliz to give you'sev de pens to
seet down, 'Sieu' Frowenfel'."</p>
<p>She spoke with a nervous tenderness in contrast with her alarmed
and entreating expression of face, and gently pushed him into a
chair.</p>
<p>The child ran behind the bed and burst into frightened sobs, but
ceased when Clotilde turned for an instant and glared at her.</p>
<p>"Mague yo' 'ead back," said Clotilde, and with tremulous
tenderness she softly pressed back his brow and began wiping off
the blood. "W'ere you is 'urted?"</p>
<p>But while she was asking her question she had found the gash and
was growing alarmed at its ugliness, when Raoul, having made
everything fast, came in with:</p>
<p>"Wat's de mattah, 'Sieur Frowenfel'? w'at's de mattah wid you?
Oo done dat, 'Sieur Frowen fel'?"</p>
<p>Joseph lifted his head and drew away from it the small hand and
wet handkerchief, and without letting go the hand, looked again
into Clotilde's eyes, and said:</p>
<p>"Go home; oh, go home!"</p>
<p>"Oh! no," protested Raoul, whereupon Clotilde turned upon him
with a perfectly amiable, nurse's grimace for silence.</p>
<p>"I goin' rad now," she said.</p>
<p>Raoul's silence was only momentary.</p>
<p>"Were you lef you' hat, 'Sieur Frowenfel'?" he asked, and stole
an artist's glance at Clotilde, while Joseph straightened up, and
nerving himself to a tolerable calmness of speech, said:</p>
<p>"I have been struck with a stick of wood by a half-witted person
under a misunderstanding of my intentions; but the circumstances
are such as to blacken my character hopelessly; but I am innocent!"
he cried, stretching forward both arms and quite losing his
momentary self-control.</p>
<p>"'Sieu' Frowenfel'!" cried Clotilde, tears leaping to her eyes,
"I am shoe of it!"</p>
<p>"I believe you! I believe you, 'Sieur Frowenfel'!" exclaimed
Raoul with sincerity.</p>
<p>"You will not believe me," said Joseph. "You will not; it will
be impossible."</p>
<p>"<i>Mais</i>" cried Clotilde, "id shall nod be impossib'!"</p>
<p>But the apothecary shook his head.</p>
<p>"All I can be suspected of will seem probable; the truth only is
incredible."</p>
<p>His head began to sink and a pallor to overspread his face.</p>
<p>"<i>Allez, Monsieur, allez</i>," cried Clotilde to Raoul, a
picture of beautiful terror which he tried afterward to paint from
memory, "<i>appelez</i> Doctah Kin!"</p>
<p>Raoul made a dash for his hat, and the next moment she heard,
with unpleasant distinctness, his impetuous hand slam the shop door
and lock her in.</p>
<p>"<i>Baille ma do l'eau</i>" she called to the little mulattress,
who responded by searching wildly for a cup and presently bringing
a measuring-glass full of water.</p>
<p>Clotilde gave it to the wounded man, and he rose at once and
stood on his feet.</p>
<p>"Raoul."</p>
<p>"'E gone at Doctah Kin."</p>
<p>"I do not need Doctor Keene; I am not badly hurt. Raoul should
not have left you here in this manner. You must not stay."</p>
<p>"Bud, 'Sieur Frowenfel', I am afred to paz dad gangue!"</p>
<p>A new distress seized Joseph in view of this additional
complication. But, unmindful of this suggestion, the fair Creole
suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>"'Sieu' Frowenfel', you har a hinnocen' man! Go, hopen yo' do's
an' stan juz as you har ub biffo dad crowd and sesso! My God!
'Sieu' Frowenfel', iv you cannod stan' ub by you'sev--"</p>
<p>She ceased suddenly with a wild look, as if another word would
have broken the levees of her eyes, and in that instant Frowenfeld
recovered the full stature of a man.</p>
<p>"God bless you!" he cried. "I will do it!" He started, then
turned again toward her, dumb for an instant, and said: "And God
reward you! You believe in me, and you do not even know me."</p>
<p>Her eyes became wilder still as she looked up into his face with
the words:</p>
<p>"<i>Mais</i>, I does know you--betteh'n you know annyt'in' boud
it!" and turned away, blushing violently.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld gave a start. She had given him too much light. He
recognized her, and she knew it. For another instant he gazed at
her averted face, and then with forced quietness said:</p>
<p>"Please go into the shop."</p>
<p>The whole time that had elapsed since the shutting of the doors
had not exceeded five minutes; a sixth sufficed for Clotilde and
her attendant to resume their original position in the nook by the
private door and for Frowenfeld to wash his face and hands. Then
the alert and numerous ears without heard a drawing of bolts at the
door next to that which Raoul had issued, its leaves opened
outward, and first the pale hands and then the white, weakened face
and still bloody hair and apparel of the apothecary made their
appearance. He opened a window and another door. The one locked by
Raoul, when unbolted, yielded without a key, and the shop stood
open.</p>
<p>"My friends," said the trembling proprietor, "if any of you
wishes to buy anything, I am ready to serve him. The rest will
please move away."</p>
<p>The invitation, though probably understood, was responded to by
only a few at the banquette's edge, where a respectable face or two
wore scrutinizing frowns. The remainder persisted in silently
standing and gazing in at the bloody man.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld bore the gaze. There was one element of emphatic
satisfaction in it--it drew their observation from Clotilde at the
other end of the shop. He stole a glance backward; she was not
there. She had watched her chance, safely escaped through the side
door, and was gone.</p>
<p>Raoul returned.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', Doctor Keene is took worse ag'in. 'E is in
bed; but 'e say to tell you in dat lill troubl' of dis mawnin' it
is himseff w'at is inti'lie wrong, an' 'e hass you poddon. 'E says
sen' fo' Doctor Conrotte, but I din go fo' him; dat ole
scoun'rel--he believe in puttin' de niggas fre'."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld said he would not consult professional advisers; with
a little assistance from Raoul, he could give the cut the slight
attention it needed. He went back into his room, while Raoul turned
back to the door and addressed the public.</p>
<p>"Pray, Messieurs, come in and be seated." He spoke in the Creole
French of the gutters. "Come in. M. Frowenfeld is dressing, and
desires that you will have a little patience. Come in. Take chairs.
You will not come in? No? Nor you, Monsieur? No? I will set some
chairs outside, eh? No?"</p>
<p>They moved by twos and threes away, and Raoul, retiring, gave
his employer such momentary aid as was required. When Joseph, in
changed dress, once more appeared, only a child or two lingered to
see him, and he had nothing to do but sit down and, as far as he
felt at liberty to do so, answer his assistant's questions.</p>
<p>During the recital, Raoul was obliged to exercise the severest
self-restraint to avoid laughing,--a feeling which was modified by
the desire to assure his employer that he understood this sort of
thing perfectly, had run the same risks himself, and thought no
less of a man, <i>providing he was a gentleman</i>, because of an
unlucky retributive knock on the head. But he feared laughter would
overclimb speech; and, indeed, with all expression of sympathy
stifled, he did not succeed so completely in hiding the conflicting
emotion but that Joseph did once turn his pale, grave face
surprisedly, hearing a snuffling sound, suddenly stifled in a
drawer of corks. Said Raoul, with an unsteady utterance, as he
slammed the drawer:</p>
<p>"H-h-dat makes me dat I can't 'elp to laugh w'en I t'ink of dat
fool yesse'dy w'at want to buy my pigshoe for honly one 'undred
dolla'--ha, ha ha, ha!"</p>
<p>He laughed almost indecorously.</p>
<p>"Raoul," said Frowenfeld, rising and closing his eyes, "I am
going back for my hat. It would make matters worse for that person
to send it to me, and it would be something like a vindication for
me to go back to the house and get it."</p>
<p>Mr. Innerarity was about to make strenuous objection, when there
came in one whom he recognized as an attach&eacute; of his cousin
Honor&eacute;'s counting-room, and handed the apothecary a note. It
contained Honor&eacute;'s request that if Frowenfeld was in his
shop he would have the goodness to wait there until the writer
could call and see him.</p>
<p>"I will wait," was the reply.</p>

<h3>"FO' WAD YOU CRYNE?"</h3>
<br>
<p>Clotilde, a step or two from home, dismissed her attendant, and
as Aurora, with anxious haste, opened to her familiar knock,
appeared before her pale and trembling.</p>
<p>"<i>Ah, ma fille</i>--"</p>
<p>The overwrought girl dropped her head and wept without restraint
upon her mother's neck. She let herself be guided to a chair, and
there, while Aurora nestled close to her side, yielded a few
moments to reverie before she was called upon to speak. Then Aurora
first quietly took possession of her hands, and after another
tender pause asked in English, which was equivalent to
whispering:</p>
<p>"Were you was, <i>ch&eacute;rie?</i>"</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'--"</p>
<p>Aurora straightened up with angry astonishment and drew in her
breath for an emphatic speech, but Clotilde, liberating her own
hands, took Aurora's, and hurriedly said, turning still paler as
she spoke:</p>
<p>"'E godd his 'ead strigue! 'Tis all knog in be'ine! 'E come in
blidding--"</p>
<p>"In w'ere?" cried Aurora.</p>
<p>"In 'is shob."</p>
<p>"You was in dad shob of 'Sieur Frowenfel'?"</p>
<p>"I wend ad 'is shob to pay doze rend."</p>
<p>"How--you wend ad 'is shob to pay--"</p>
<p>Clotilde produced the bracelet. The two looked at each other in
silence for a moment, while Aurora took in without further
explanation Clotilde's project and its failure.</p>
<p>"An' 'Sieur Frowenfel'--dey kill 'im? Ah! <i>Ma
ch&egrave;re</i>, fo' wad you mague me to hass all dose
question?"</p>
<p>Clotilde gave a brief account of the matter, omitting only her
conversation with Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais</i>, oo strigue 'im?" demanded Aurora, impatiently.</p>
<p>"Addunno!" replied the other. "Bud I does know 'e is
hinnocen'!"</p>
<p>A small scouting-party of tears reappeared on the edge of her

<p>"Ah, non, my chile, I know fo' wad you cryne: 't is h-only de

<p>"Oh, sighd of blood!"</p>
<p>Clotilde let a little nervous laugh escape through her
dejection.</p>
<p>"Well, then,"--Aurora's eyes twinkled like stars,--"id muz be

<p>"'Tis nod tru'!" cried Clotilde; but, instead of laughing, as
Aurora had supposed she would, she sent a double flash of light
from her eyes, crimsoned, and retorted, as the tears again sprang
from their lurking-place, "You wand to mague ligue you don't kyah!
But <i>I</i> know! I know verrie well! You kyah fifty time' as

<br>
<p>Aurora was quite dumb for a moment, and gazed at Clotilde,
wondering what could have made her so unlike herself. Then she half
rose up, and, as she reached forward an arm, and laid it tenderly
about her daughter's neck, said:</p>

<p>"Ah! don godd sens'!" cried Clotilde, lifting her head up
suddenly with a face of agony. "'E reg--'e reggo-ni-i-ize me!"</p>
<p>Aurora caught her daughter's cheeks between her hands and
laughed all over them.</p>

<p>Clotilde replied with a smile of grieved incredulity.</p>

forefinger of one hand upon that of the other and kissed them,
reversed the cross and kissed them again. "<i>Mais</i>, ad de sem

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h3>AURORA'S LAST PICAYUNE</h3>
<br>
<p>Not often in Aurora's life had joy and trembling so been mingled
in one cup as on this day. Clotilde wept; and certainly the
mother's heart could but respond; yet Clotilde's tears filled her
with a secret pleasure which fought its way up into the beams of
her eyes and asserted itself in the frequency and heartiness of her
laugh despite her sincere participation in her companion's
distresses and a fearful looking forward to to-morrow.</p>
<p>Why these flashes of gladness? If we do not know, it is because
we have overlooked one of her sources of trouble. From the night of
the <i>bal masqu&eacute;</i> she had--we dare say no more than that
she had been haunted; she certainly would not at first have
admitted even so much to herself. Yet the fact was not thereby
altered, and first the fact and later the feeling had given her
much distress of mind. Who he was whose image would not down, for a
long time she did not know. This, alone, was torture; not merely
because it was mystery, but because it helped to force upon her
consciousness that her affections, spite of her, were ready and
waiting for him and he did not come after them. That he loved her,
she knew; she had achieved at the ball an overwhelming victory, to
her certain knowledge, or, depend upon it, she never would have
unmasked--never.</p>
<p>But with this torture was mingled not only the ecstasy of
loving, but the fear of her daughter. This is a world that allows
nothing without its obverse and reverse. Strange differences are
often seen between the two sides; and one of the strangest and most
inharmonious in this world of human relations is that coinage which
a mother sometimes finds herself offering to a daughter, and which
reads on one side, Bridegroom, and on the other, Stepfather.</p>
<p>Then, all this torture to be hidden under smiles! Worse still,
when by and by Messieurs Agoussou, Assonquer, Danny and others had
been appealed to and a Providence boundless in tender compassion
had answered in their stead, she and her lover had simultaneously
discovered each other's identity only to find that he was a
Montague to her Capulet. And the source of her agony must be
hidden, and falsely attributed to the rent deficiency and their
unprotected lives. Its true nature must be concealed even from
Clotilde. What a secret--for what a spirit--to keep from what a
companion!--a secret yielding honey to her, but, it might be, gall
to Clotilde. She felt like one locked in the Garden of Eden all
alone--alone with all the ravishing flowers, alone with all the
lions and tigers. She wished she had told the secret when it was
small and had let it increase by gradual accretions in Clotilde's
knowledge day by day. At first it had been but a garland, then it
had become a chain, now it was a ball and chain; and it was oh! and
oh! if Clotilde would only fall in love herself! How that would
simplify matters! More than twice or thrice she had tried to reveal
her overstrained heart in broken sections; but on her approach to
the very outer confines of the matter, Clotilde had always behaved
so strangely, so nervously, in short, so beyond Aurora's
comprehension, that she invariably failed to make any
revelation.</p>
<p>And now, here in the very central darkness of this cloud of
troubles, comes in Clotilde, throws herself upon the defiant little
bosom so full of hidden suffering, and weeps tears of innocent
confession that in a moment lay the dust of half of Aurora's
perplexities. Strange world! The tears of the orphan making the
widow weep for joy, if she only dared.</p>
<p>The pair sat down opposite each other at their little
dinner-table. They had a fixed hour for dinner. It is well to have
a fixed hour; it is in the direction of system. Even if you have
not the dinner, there is the hour. Alphonsina was not in perfect
harmony with this fixed-hour idea. It was Aurora's belief, often
expressed in hungry moments with the laugh of a vexed Creole lady
(a laugh worthy of study), that on the day when dinner should
really be served at the appointed hour, the cook would drop dead of
apoplexy and she of fright. She said it to-day, shutting her arms
down to her side, closing her eyes with her eyebrows raised, and
dropping into her chair at the table like a dead bird from its
perch. Not that she felt particularly hungry; but there is a
certain desultoriness allowable at table more than elsewhere, and
which suited the hither-thither movement of her conflicting
feelings. This is why she had wished for dinner.</p>
<p>Boiled shrimps, rice, claret-and-water, bread--they were dining
well the day before execution. Dining is hardly correct, either,
for Clotilde, at least, did not eat; they only sat. Clotilde had,
too, if not her unknown, at least her unconfessed emotions.
Aurora's were tossed by the waves, hers were sunken beneath them.
Aurora had a faith that the rent would be paid--a faith which was
only a vapor, but a vapor gilded by the sun--that is, by Apollo,
or, to be still more explicit, by Honor&eacute; Grandissime.
Clotilde, deprived of this confidence, had tried to raise means
wherewith to meet the dread obligation, or, rather, had tried to
try and had failed. To-day was the ninth, to-morrow, the street.
Joseph Frowenfeld was hurt; her dependence upon his good offices
was gone. When she thought of him suffering under public contumely,
it seemed to her as if she could feel the big drops of blood
dropping from her heart; and when she recalled her own actions,
speeches, and demonstrations in his presence, exaggerated by the
groundless fear that he had guessed into the deepest springs of her
feelings, then she felt those drops of blood congeal. Even if the
apothecary had been duller of discernment than she supposed, here
was Aurora on the opposite side of the table, reading every thought
of her inmost soul. But worst of all was 'Sieur Frowenfel's
indifference. It is true that, as he had directed upon her that
gaze of recognition, there was a look of mighty gladness, if she
dared believe her eyes. But no, she dared not; there was nothing
there for her, she thought,--probably (when this anguish of public
disgrace should by any means be lifted) a benevolent smile at her
and her betrayal of interest. Clotilde felt as though she had been
laid entire upon a slide of his microscope.</p>
<p>Aurora at length broke her reverie.</p>
<p>"Clotilde,"--she spoke in French--"the matter with you is that
you have no heart. You never did have any. Really and truly, you do
not care whether 'Sieur Frowenfel' lives or dies. You do not care
how he is or where he is this minute. I wish you had some of my too
large heart. I not only have the heart, as I tell you, to think
kindly of our enemies, those Grandissime, for example"--she waved
her hand with the air of selecting at random--"but I am burning up
to know what is the condition of that poor, sick, noble 'Sieur
Frowenfel', and I am going to do it!"</p>
<p>The heart which Clotilde was accused of not having gave a stir
of deep gratitude. Dear, pretty little mother! Not only knowing
full well the existence of this swelling heart and the
significance, to-day, of its every warm pulsation, but kindly
covering up the discovery with make-believe reproaches. The tears
started in her eyes; that was her reply.</p>
<p>"Oh, now! it is the rent again, I suppose," cried Aurora,
"always the rent. It is not the rent that worries <i>me</i>, it is
'Sieur Frowenfel', poor man. But very well, Mademoiselle Silence, I
will match you for making me do all the talking." She was really
beginning to sink under the labor of carrying all the sprightliness
for both. "Come," she said, savagely, "propose something."</p>
<p>"Would you think well to go and inquire?"</p>
<p>"Ah, listen! Go and what? No, Mademoiselle, I think not."</p>
<p>"Well, send Alphonsina."</p>
<p>"What? And let him know that I am anxious about him? Let me tell
you, my little girl, I shall not drag upon myself the
responsibility of increasing the self-conceit of any of that
sex."</p>
<p>"Well, then, send to buy a picayune's worth of something."</p>
<p>"Ah, ha, ha! An emetic, for instance. Tell him we are poisoned
on mushrooms, ha, ha, ha!"</p>
<p>Clotilde laughed too.</p>
<p>"Ah, no," she said. "Send for something he does not sell."</p>
<p>Aurora was laughing while Clotilde spoke; but as she caught
these words she stopped with open-mouthed astonishment, and, as
Clotilde blushed, laughed again.</p>
<p>"Oh, Clotilde, Clotilde, Clotilde!"--she leaned forward over the
table, her face beaming with love and laughter--"you rowdy! you
rascal! You are just as bad as your mother, whom you think so
wicked! I accept your advice. Alphonsina!"</p>
<p>"Momselle!"</p>
<p>The answer came from the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Come go--or, rather,--<i>vini 'ci courri dans boutique de
l'apothecaire</i>. Clotilde," she continued, in better French,
holding up the coin to view, "look!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"The last picayune we have in the world--ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<h3>HONOR&Eacute; MAKES SOME CONFESSIONS</h3>
<br>
<p>"Comment &ccedil;&agrave; va, Raoul?" said Honor&eacute;
Grandissime; he had come to the shop according to the proposal
contained in his note. "Where is Mr. Frowenfeld?"</p>
<p>He found the apothecary in the rear room, dressed, but just
rising from the bed at sound of his voice. He closed the door after
him; they shook hands and took chairs.</p>
<p>"You have fever," said the merchant. "I have been troubled that
way myself, some, lately." He rubbed his face all over, hard, with
one hand,' and looked at the ceiling. "Loss of sleep, I suppose, in
both of us; in your case voluntary--in pursuit of study, most
likely; in my case--effect of anxiety." He smiled a moment and then
suddenly sobered as after a pause he said:</p>
<p>"But I hear you are in trouble; may I ask--"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld had interrupted him with almost the same words:</p>
<p>"May I venture to ask, Mr. Grandissime, what--"</p>
<p>And both were silent for a moment.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Honor&eacute;, with a gesture. "My trouble--I did not
mean to mention it; 't is an old matter--in part. You know, Mr.
Frowenfeld, there is a kind of tree not dreamed of in botany, that
lets fall its fruit every day in the year--you know? We call
it--with reverence--'our dead father's mistakes.' I have had to eat
much of that fruit; a man who has to do that must expect to have
now and then a little fever."</p>
<p>"I have heard," replied Frowenfeld, "that some of the titles
under which your relatives hold their lands are found to be of the
kind which the State's authorities are pronouncing worthless. I
hope this is not the case."</p>
<p>"I wish they had never been put into my custody," said M.
Grandissime.</p>
<p>Some new thought moved him to draw his chair closer.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld, those two ladies whom you went to see the other
evening--"</p>
<p>His listener started a little:</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did they ever tell you their history?"</p>
<p>"No, sir; but I have heard it."</p>
<p>"And you think they have been deeply wronged, eh? Come, Mr.
Frowenfeld, take right hold of the acacia-bush." M. Grandissime did
not smile.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld winced. "I think they have."</p>
<p>"And you think restitution should be made them, no doubt,
eh?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"At any cost?"</p>
<p>The questioner showed a faint, unpleasant smile, that stirred
something like opposition in the breast of the apothecary.</p>
<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>
<p>The next question had a tincture even of fierceness:</p>
<p>"You think it right to sink fifty or a hundred people into
poverty to lift one or two out?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Grandissime," said Frowenfeld, slowly, "you bade me study
this community."</p>
<p>"I adv--yes; what is it you find?"</p>
<p>"I find--it may be the same with other communities, I suppose it
is, more or less--that just upon the culmination of the moral issue
it turns and asks the question which is behind it, instead of the
question which is before it."</p>
<p>"And what is the question before me?"</p>
<p>"I know it only in the abstract."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>The apothecary looked distressed.</p>
<p>"You should not make me say it," he objected.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless," said the Creole, "I take that liberty."</p>
<p>"Well, then," said Frowenfeld, "the question behind is
Expediency and the question in front, Divine Justice. You are
asking yourself--"</p>
<p>He checked himself.</p>
<p>"Which I ought to regard," said M. Grandissime, quickly.
"Expediency, of course, and be like the rest of mankind." He put on
a look of bitter humor. "It is all easy enough for you, Mr.
Frowenfeld, my-de'-seh; you have the easy part--the
theorizing."</p>
<p>He saw the ungenerousness of his speech as soon as it was
uttered, yet he did not modify it.</p>
<p>"True, Mr. Grandissime," said Frowenfeld; and after a
pause--"but you have the noble part--the doing."</p>
<p>"Ah, my-de'-seh!" exclaimed Honor&eacute;; "the noble part!
There is the bitterness of the draught! The opportunity to act is
pushed upon me, but the opportunity to act nobly has passed
by."</p>
<p>He again drew his chair closer, glanced behind him and spoke
low:</p>
<p>"Because for years I have had a kind of custody of all my
kinsmen's property interests, Agricola's among them, it is supposed
that he has always kept the plantation of Aurore Nancanou (or
rather of Clotilde--who, you know, by our laws is the real heir).
That is a mistake. Explain it as you please, call it remorse,
pride, love--what you like--while I was in France and he was
managing my mother's business, unknown to me he gave me that
plantation. When I succeeded him I found it and all its revenues
kept distinct--as was but proper--from all other accounts, and
belonging to me. 'Twas a fine, extensive place, had a good overseer
on it and--I kept it. Why? Because I was a coward. I did not want
it or its revenues; but, like my father, I would not offend my
people. Peace first and justice afterwards--that was the principle
on which I quietly made myself the trustee of a plantation and
income which you would have given back to their owners, eh?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld was silent.</p>
<p>"My-de'-seh, recollect that to us the Grandissime name is a
treasure. And what has preserved it so long? Cherishing the unity
of our family; that has done it; that is how my father did it. Just
or unjust, good or bad, needful or not, done elsewhere or not, I do
not say; but it is a Creole trait. See, even now" (the speaker
smiled on one side of his mouth) "in a certain section of the
territory certain men, Creoles" (he whispered, gravely), "<i>some
Grandissimes among them</i>, evading the United States revenue laws
and even beating and killing some of the officials: well! Do the
people at large repudiate those men? My-de'-seh, in no wise, seh!
No; if they were <i>Am&eacute;ricains</i>--but a Louisianian--is a
Louisianian; touch him not; when you touch him you touch all
Louisiana! So with us Grandissimes; we are legion, but we are one.
Now, my-de'-seh, the thing you ask me to do is to cast overboard
that old traditional principle which is the secret of our
existence."</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> ask you?"</p>
<p>"Ah, bah! you know you expect it. Ah! but you do not know the
uproar such an action would make. And no 'noble part' in it,
my-de'-seh, either. A few months ago--when we met by those
graves--if I had acted then, my action would have been one of
pure--even violent--<i>self</i>-sacrifice. Do you remember--on the
levee, by the Place d'Armes--me asking you to send Agricola to me?
I tried then to speak of it. He would not let me. Then, my people
felt safe in their land-titles and public offices; this restitution
would have hurt nothing but pride. Now, titles in doubt, government
appointments uncertain, no ready capital in reach for any purpose,
except that which would have to be handed over with the plantation
(for to tell you the fact, my-de'-seh, no other account on my books
has prospered), with matters changed in this way, I become the
destroyer of my own flesh and blood! Yes, seh! and lest I might
still find some room to boast, another change moves me into a
position where it suits me, my-de'-seh, to make the restitution so
fatal to those of my name. When you and I first met, those ladies
were as much strangers to me as to you--as far as I <i>knew</i>.
Then, if I had done this thing--but now--now, my-de'-seh, I find
myself in love with one of them!"</p>
<p>M. Grandissime looked his friend straight in the eye with the
frowning energy of one who asserts an ugly fact.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld, regarding the speaker with a gaze of respectful
attention, did not falter; but his fevered blood, with an impulse
that started him half from his seat, surged up into his head and
face; and then--</p>
<p>M. Grandissime blushed.</p>
<p>In the few silent seconds that followed, the glances of the two
friends continued to pass into each other's eyes, while about
Honor&eacute;'s mouth hovered the smile of one who candidly
surrenders his innermost secret, and the lips of the apothecary set
themselves together as though he were whispering to himself behind
them, "Steady."</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld," said the Creole, taking a sudden breath and
waving a hand, "I came to ask about <i>your</i> trouble; but if you
think you have any reason to withhold your confidence--"</p>
<p>"No, sir; no! But can I be no help to you in this matter?"</p>
<p>The Creole leaned back smilingly in his chair and knit his
fingers.</p>
<p>"No, I did not intend to say all this; I came to offer my help
to you; but my mind is full--what do you expect? My-de'-seh, the
foam must come first out of the bottle. You see"--he leaned forward
again, laid two fingers in his palm and deepened his tone--"I will
tell you: this tree--'our dead father's mistakes'--is about to drop
another rotten apple. I spoke just now of the uproar this
restitution would make; why, my-de'-seh, just the mention of the
lady's name at my house, when we lately held the <i>f&ecirc;te de
grandp&egrave;re</i>, has given rise to a quarrel which is likely
to end in a duel."</p>
<p>"Raoul was telling me," said the apothecary.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime made an affirmative gesture.</p>
<p>"Mr. Frowenfeld, if you--if any one--could teach my people--I
mean my family--the value of peace (I do not say the duty,
my-de'-seh; a merchant talks of values); if you could teach them
the value of peace, I would give you, if that was your price"--he
ran the edge of his left hand knife-wise around the wrist of his
right--"that. And if you would teach it to the whole
community--well--I think I would not give my head; maybe you
would." He laughed.</p>
<p>"There is a peace which is bad," said the contemplative
apothecary.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the Creole, promptly, "the very kind that I have
been keeping all this time--and my father before me!"</p>
<p>He spoke with much warmth.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said again, after a pause which was not a rest, "I
often see that we Grandissimes are a good example of the Creoles at
large; we have one element that makes for peace; that--pardon the
self-consciousness--is myself; and another element that makes for
strife--led by my uncle Agricola; but, my-de'-seh, the peace
element is that which ought to make the strife, and the strife
element is that which ought to be made to keep the peace! Mr.
Frowenfeld, I propose to become the strife-maker; how then, can I
be a peacemaker at the same time? There is my diffycultie."</p>
<p>"Mr. Grandissime," exclaimed Frowenfeld, "if you have any design
in view founded on the high principles which I know to be the
foundations of all your feelings, and can make use of the aid of a
disgraced man, use me."</p>
<p>"You are very generous," said the Creole, and both were silent.
Honor&eacute; dropped his eyes from Frowenfeld's to the floor,
rubbed his knee with his palm, and suddenly looked up.</p>
<p>"You are innocent of wrong?"</p>
<p>"Before God."</p>
<p>"I feel sure of it. Tell me in a few words all about it. I ought
to be able to extricate you. Let me hear it."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld again told as much as he thought he could,
consistently with his pledges to Palmyre, touching with extreme
lightness upon the part taken by Clotilde.</p>
<p>"Turn around," said M. Grandissime at the close; "let me see the
back of your head. And it is that that is giving you this fever,
eh?"</p>
<p>"Partly," replied Frowenfeld; "but how shall I vindicate my
innocence? I think I ought to go back openly to this woman's house
and get my hat. I was about to do that when I got your note; yet it
seems a feeble--even if possible--expedient."</p>
<p>"My friend," said Honor&eacute;, "leave it to me. I see your
whole case, both what you tell and what you conceal. I guess it
with ease. Knowing Palmyre so well, and knowing (what you do not)
that all the voudous in town think you a sorcerer, I know just what
she would drop down and beg you for--a <i>ouangan</i>, ha, ha! You
see? Leave it all to me--and your hat with Palmyre, take a
febrifuge and a nap, and await word from me."</p>
<p>"And may I offer you no help in your difficulty?" asked the
apothecary, as the two rose and grasped hands.</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the Creole, with a little shrug, "you may do anything
you can--which will be nothing."</p>

<h3>TESTS OF FRIENDSHIP</h3>
<br>
<p>Frowenfeld turned away from the closing door, caught his head
between his hands and tried to comprehend the new wildness of the
tumult within. Honor&eacute; Grandissime avowedly in love with one
of them--<i>which one</i>? Doctor Keene visibly in love with one of
them--<i>which one</i>? And he! What meant this bounding joy that,
like one gorgeous moth among innumerable bats, flashed to and fro
among the wild distresses and dismays swarming in and out of his
distempered imagination? He did not answer the question; he only
knew the confusion in his brain was dreadful. Both hands could not
hold back the throbbing of his temples; the table did not steady
the trembling of his hands; his thoughts went hither and thither,
heedless of his call. Sit down as he might, rise up, pace the room,
stand, lean his forehead against the wall--nothing could quiet the
fearful disorder, until at length he recalled Honor&eacute;'s
neglected advice and resolutely lay down and sought sleep; and,
long before he had hoped to secure it, it came.</p>
<p>In the distant Grandissime mansion, Agricola Fusilier was
casting about for ways and means to rid himself of the heaviest
heart that ever had throbbed in his bosom. He had risen at sunrise
from slumber worse than sleeplessness, in which his dreams had
anticipated the duel of to-morrow with Sylvestre. He was trying to
get the unwonted quaking out of his hands and the memory of the
night's heart-dissolving phantasms from before his inner vision. To
do this he had resort to a very familiar, we may say time-honored,
prescription--rum. He did not use it after the voudou fashion; the
voudous pour it on the ground--Agricola was an anti-voudou. It
finally had its effect. By eleven o'clock he seemed, outwardly at
least, to be at peace with everything in Louisiana that he
considered Louisianian, properly so-called; as to all else he was
ready for war, as in peace one should be. While in this mood, and
performing at a sideboard the solemn rite of <i>las onze</i>, news
incidentally reached him, by the mouth of his busy second,
Hippolyte, of Frowenfeld's trouble, and despite 'Polyte's
protestations against the principal in a pending "affair" appearing
on the street, he ordered the carriage and hurried to the
apothecary's.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>When Frowenfeld awoke, the fingers of his clock were passing the
meridan. His fever was gone, his brain was calm, his strength in
good measure had returned. There had been dreams in his sleep, too;
he had seen Clotilde standing at the foot of his bed. He lay now,
for a moment, lost in retrospection.</p>
<p>"There can be no doubt about it," said he, as he rose up,
looking back mentally at something in the past.</p>
<p>The sound of carriage-wheels attracted his attention by ceasing
before his street door. A moment later the voice of Agricola was
heard in the shop greeting Raoul. As the old man lifted the head of
his staff to tap on the inner door, Frowenfeld opened it.</p>
<p>"Fusilier to the rescue!" said the great Louisianian, with a
grasp of the apothecary's hand and a gaze of brooding
admiration.</p>
<p>Joseph gave him a chair, but with magnificent humility he
insisted on not taking it until "Professor Frowenfeld" had himself
sat down.</p>
<p>The apothecary was very solemn. It seemed to him as if in this
little back room his dead good name was lying in state, and these
visitors were coming in to take their last look. From time to time
he longed for more light, wondering why the gravity of his
misadventure should seem so great.</p>
<p>"H-m-h-y dear Professor!" began the old man. Pages of print
could not comprise all the meanings of his smile and accent;
benevolence, affection, assumed knowledge of the facts, disdain of
results, remembrance of his own youth, charity for pranks,
patronage--these were but a few. He spoke very slowly and deeply
and with this smile of a hundred meanings. "Why did you not send
for me, Joseph? Sir, whenever you have occasion to make a list of
the friends who will stand by you, <i>right or wrong</i>--h-write
the name of Citizen Agricola Fusilier at the top! Write it large
and repeat it at the bottom! You understand me, Joseph?--and, mark
me,--right or wrong!"</p>
<p>"Not wrong," said Frowenfeld, "at least not in defence of wrong;
I could not do that; but, I assure you, in this matter I have
done--"</p>
<p>"No worse than any one else would have done under the
circumstances, my dear boy!--Nay, nay, do not interrupt me; I
understand you, I understand you. H-do you imagine there is
anything strange to me in this--at my age?"</p>
<p>"But I am--"</p>
<p>"--all right, sir! that is <i>what</i> you are. And you are
under the wing of Agricola Fusilier, the old eagle; that is
<i>where</i> you are. And you are one of my brood; that is
<i>who</i> you are. Professor, listen to your old father.
<i>The--man--makes--the--crime!</i> The wisdom of mankind never
brought forth a maxim of more gigantic beauty. If the different
grades of race and society did not have corresponding moral and
civil liberties, varying in degree as they vary--h-why! <i>this</i>
community, at least, would go to pieces! See here! Professor
Frowenfeld is charged with misdemeanor. Very well, who is he?
Foreigner or native? Foreigner by sentiment and intention, or only
by accident of birth? Of our mental fibre--our aspirations--our
delights--our indignations? I answer for you, Joseph, yes!--yes!
What then? H-why, then the decision! Reached how? By apologetic
reasonings? By instinct, sir! h-h-that guide of the nobly proud!
And what is the decision? Not guilty. Professor Frowenfeld,
<i>absolvo te!</i>"</p>
<p>It was in vain that the apothecary repeatedly tried to interrupt
this speech. "Citizen Fusilier, do you know me no
better?"--"Citizen Fusilier, if you will but listen!"--such were
the fragments of his efforts to explain. The old man was not so
confident as he pretended to be that Frowenfeld was that complete
proselyte which alone satisfies a Creole; but he saw him in a
predicament and cast to him this life-buoy, which if a man should
refuse, he would deserve to drown.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld tried again to begin.</p>
<p>"Mr. Fusilier--"</p>
<p>"Citizen Fusilier!"</p>
<p>"Citizen, candor demands that I undeceive--"</p>
<p>"Candor demands--h-my dear Professor, let me tell you exactly
what she demands. She demands that in here--within this
apartment--we understand each other. That demand is met."</p>
<p>"But--" Frowenfeld frowned impatiently.</p>
<p>"That demand, Joseph, is fully met! I understand the whole
matter like an eye-witness! Now there is another demand to be met,
the demand of friendship! In here, candor; outside, friendship; in
here, one of our brethren has been adventurous and unfortunate;
outside"--the old man smiled a smile of benevolent
mendacity--"outside, nothing has happened."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld insisted savagely on speaking; but Agricola raised
his voice, and gray hairs prevailed.</p>
<p>"At least, what <i>has</i> happened? The most ordinary thing in
the world; Professor Frowenfeld lost his footing on a slippery
gunwale, fell, cut his head upon a protruding spike, and went into
the house of Palmyre to bathe his wound; but finding it worse than
he had at first supposed it, immediately hurried out again and came
to his store. He left his hat where it had fallen, too muddy to be
worth recovery. Hippolyte Brahmin-Mandarin and others, passing at
the time, thought he had met with violence in the house of the
hair-dresser, and drew some natural inferences, but have since been
better informed; and the public will please understand that
Professor Frowenfeld is a white man, a gentleman, and a
Louisianian, ready to vindicate his honor, and that Citizen
Agricola Fusilier is his friend!"</p>
<p>The old man looked around with the air of a bull on a
hill-top.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld, vexed beyond degree, restrained himself only for the
sake of an object in view, and contented himself with repeating for
the fourth or fifth time,--</p>
<p>"I cannot accept any such deliverance."</p>
<p>"Professor Frowenfeld, friendship--society--demands it; our
circle must be protected in all its members. You have nothing to do
with it. You will leave it with me, Joseph."</p>
<p>"No, no," said Frowenfeld, "I thank you, but--"</p>
<p>"Ah! my dear boy, thank me not; I cannot help these impulses; I
belong to a warm-hearted race. But"--he drew back in his chair
sidewise and made great pretence of frowning--"you decline the
offices of that precious possession, a Creole friend?"</p>
<p>"I only decline to be shielded by a fiction."</p>
<p>"Ah-h!" said Agricola, further nettling his victim by a gaze of
stagy admiration. "'<i>Sans peur et sans reproche</i>'--and yet you
disappoint me. Is it for naught, that I have sallied forth from
home, drawing the curtains of my carriage to shield me from the
gazing crowd? It was to rescue my friend--my vicar--my
coadjutor--my son--from the laughs and finger-points of the vulgar
mass. H-I might as well have stayed at home--or better, for my
peculiar position to-day rather requires me to keep in--"</p>
<p>"No, citizen," said Frowenfeld, laying his hand upon Agricola's
arm, "I trust it is not in vain that you have come out. There
<i>is</i> a man in trouble whom only you can deliver."</p>
<p>The old man began to swell with complacency.</p>
<p>"H-why, really--"</p>
<p>"<i>He</i>, Citizen, is truly of your kind--"</p>
<p>"He must be delivered, Professor Frowenfeld--"</p>
<p>"He is a native Louisianian, not only by accident of birth but
by sentiment and intention," said Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>The old man smiled a benign delight, but the apothecary now had
the upper hand, and would not hear him speak.</p>
<p>"His aspirations," continued the speaker, "his
indignations--mount with his people's. His pulse beats with yours,
sir. He is a part of your circle. He is one of your caste."</p>
<p>Agricola could not be silent.</p>
<p>"Ha-a-a-ah! Joseph, h-h-you make my blood tingle! Speak to the
point; who--"</p>
<p>"I believe him, moreover, Citizen Fusilier, innocent of the
charge laid--"</p>
<p>"H-innocent? H-of course he is innocent, sir! We will
<i>make</i> him inno--"</p>
<p>"Ah! Citizen, he is already under sentence of death!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i> A Creole under sentence!" Agricola swore a heathen
oath, set his knees apart and grasped his staff by the middle.
"Sir, we will liberate him if we have to overturn the
government!"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld shook his head.</p>
<p>"You have got to overturn something stronger than
government."</p>
<p>"And pray what--"</p>
<p>"A conventionality," said Frowenfeld, holding the old man's
eye.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha! my b-hoy, h-you are right. But we will
overturn--eh?"</p>
<p>"I say I fear your engagements will prevent. I hear you take
part to-morrow morning in--"</p>
<p>Agricola suddenly stiffened.</p>
<p>"Professor Frowenfeld, it strikes me, sir, you are taking
something of a liberty."</p>
<p>"For which I ask pardon," exclaimed Frowenfeld. "Then I may not
expect--"</p>
<p>The old man melted again.</p>
<p>"But who is this person in mortal peril?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld hesitated.</p>
<p>"Citizen Fusilier," he said, looking first down at the floor and
then up into the inquirer's face, "on my assurance that he is not
only a native Creole, but a Grandissime--"</p>
<p>"It is not possible!" exclaimed Agricola.</p>
<p>"--a Grandissime of the purest blood, will you pledge me your
aid to liberate him from his danger, 'right or wrong'?"</p>
<p>"<i>Will</i> I? H-why, certainly! Who is he?"</p>
<p>"Citizen--it is Sylves--"</p>
<p>Agricola sprang up with a thundering oath.</p>
<p>The apothecary put out a pacifying hand, but it was spurned.</p>
<br>

<b>"His head was bowed, a heavy grizzled lock fell down upon his
dark, frowning brow, one hand clenched the top of his staff, the
other his knee, and both trembled violently".</b></p>
<br>
<p>"Let me go! How dare you, sir? How dare you, sir?" bellowed
Agricola.</p>
<p>He started toward the door, cursing furiously and keeping his
eye fixed on Frowenfeld with a look of rage not unmixed with
terror.</p>
<p>"Citizen Fusilier," said the apothecary, following him with one
palm uplifted, as if that would ward off his abuse, "don't go! I
adjure you, don't go! Remember your pledge, Citizen Fusilier!"</p>
<p>Agricola did not pause a moment; but when he had swung the door
violently open the way was still obstructed. The painter of
"Louisiana refusing to enter the Union" stood before him, his head
elevated loftily, one foot set forward and his arm extended like a
tragedian's.</p>
<p>"Stan' bag-sah!"</p>
<p>"Let me pass! Let me pass, or I will kill you!"</p>
<p>Mr. Innerarity smote his bosom and tossed his hand aloft.</p>
<p>"Kill me-firse an' pass aftah!"</p>
<p>"Citizen Fusilier," said Frowenfeld, "I beg you to hear me."</p>
<p>"Go away! Go away!"</p>
<p>The old man drew back from the door and stood in the corner
against the book-shelves as if all the horrors of the last night's
dreams had taken bodily shape in the person of the apothecary. He
trembled and stammered:</p>
<p>"Ke--keep off! Keep off! My God! Raoul, he has insulted me!" He
made a miserable show of drawing a weapon. "No man may insult me
and live! If you are a man, Professor Frowenfeld, you will defend
yourself!"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld lost his temper, but his hasty reply was drowned by
Raoul's vehement speech.</p>
<p>"'Tis not de trute!" cried Raoul. "He try to save you from
hell-'n'-damnation w'en 'e h-ought to give you a good cuss'n!"--and
in the ecstasy of his anger burst into tears.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld, in an agony of annoyance, waved him away and he
disappeared, shutting the door.</p>
<p>Agricola, moved far more from within than from without, had sunk
into a chair under the shelves. His head was bowed, a heavy
grizzled lock fell down upon his dark, frowning brow, one hand
clenched the top of his staff, the other his knee, and both
trembled violently. As Frowenfeld, with every demonstration of
beseeching kindness, began to speak, he lifted his eyes and said,
piteously:</p>
<p>"Stop! Stop!"</p>
<p>"Citizen Fusilier, it is you who must stop. Stop before God
Almighty stops you, I beg you. I do not presume to rebuke you. I
<i>know</i> you want a clear record. I know it better to-day than I
ever did before. Citizen Fusilier, I honor your intentions--"</p>
<p>Agricola roused a little and looked up with a miserable attempt
at his habitual patronizing smile.</p>
<p>"H-my dear boy, I overlook"--but he met in</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's eyes a spirit so superior to his dissimulation that
the smile quite broke down and gave way to another of deprecatory
and apologetic distress. He reached up an arm.</p>
<p>"I could easily convince you, Professor, of your error"--his
eyes quailed and dropped to the floor--"but I--your arm, my dear
Joseph; age is creeping upon me." He rose to his feet. "I am
feeling really indisposed to-day--not at all bright; my solicitude
for you, my dear b--"</p>
<p>He took two or three steps forward, tottered, clung to the
apothecary, moved another step or two, and grasping the edge of the
table stumbled into a chair which Frowenfeld thrust under him. He
folded his arms on the edge of the board and rested his forehead on
them, while Frowenfeld sat down quickly on the opposite side, drew
paper and pen across the table and wrote.</p>
<p>"Are you writing something, Professor?" asked the old man,
without stirring. His staff tumbled to the floor. The apothecary's
answer was a low, preoccupied one. Two or three times over he wrote
and rejected what he had written.</p>
<p>Presently he pushed back his chair, came around the table, laid
the writing he had made before the bowed head, sat down again and
waited.</p>
<p>After a long time the old man looked up, trying in vain to
conceal his anguish under a smile.</p>
<p>"I have a sad headache."</p>
<p>He cast his eyes over the table and took mechanically the pen
which Frowenfeld extended toward him.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you, Professor? Sign something? There is
nothing I would not do for Professor Frowenfeld. What have you
written, eh?"</p>
<p>He felt helplessly for his spectacles.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld read:</p>
<p>"<i>Mr. Sylvestre Grandissime: I spoke in haste</i>."</p>
<p>He felt himself tremble as he read. Agricola fumbled with the
pen, lifted his eyes with one more effort at the old look, said,
"My dear boy, I do this purely to please you," and to Frowenfeld's
delight and astonishment wrote:</p>
<p>"<i>Your affectionate uncle, Agricola Fusilier</i>."</p>

<h3>LOUISIANA STATES HER WANTS</h3>
<br>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'," said Raoul as that person turned in the
front door of the shop after watching Agricola's carriage roll
away--he had intended to unburden his mind to the apothecary with
all his natural impetuosity; but Frowenfeld's gravity as he turned,
with the paper in his hand, induced a different manner. Raoul had
learned, despite all the impulses of his nature, to look upon
Frowenfeld with a sort of enthusiastic awe. He dropped his voice
and said--asking like a child a question he was perfectly able to
answer--</p>
<p>"What de matta wid Agricole?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld, for the moment well-nigh oblivious of his own
trouble, turned upon his assistant a look in which elation was
oddly blended with solemnity, and replied as he walked by:</p>
<p>"Rush of truth to the heart."</p>
<p>Raoul followed a step.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'--"</p>
<p>The apothecary turned once more. Raoul's face bore an expression
of earnest practicability that invited confidence.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', Agricola writ'n' to Sylvestre to stop dat
dool?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You goin' take dat lett' to Sylvestre?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', dat de wrong g-way. You got to take it to
'Polyte Brahmin-Mandarin, an' 'e got to take it to Valentine
Grandissime, an' '<i>e</i> got to take it to Sylvestre. You see,
you got to know de manner to make. Once 'pon a time I had a
diffycultie wid--"</p>
<p>"I see," said Frowenfeld; "where may I find Hippolyte
Brahmin-Mandarin at this time of day?"</p>
<p>Raoul shrugged.</p>
<p>"If the pre-parish-ions are not complitted, you will not find
'im; but if they har complitted--you know 'im?"</p>
<p>"By sight."</p>
<p>"Well, you may fine him at Maspero's, or helse in de front of de
Veau-qui-t&ecirc;te, or helse at de Caf&eacute; Louis
Quatorze--mos' likely in front of de Veau-qui-t&ecirc;te. You know,
dat diffycultie I had, dat arise itseff from de discush'n of one of
de mil-littery mov'ments of ca-valry; you know, I--"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the apothecary; "here, Raoul, is some money; please
go and buy me a good, plain hat."</p>
<p>"All right." Raoul darted behind the counter and got his hat out
of a drawer. "Were at you buy your hats?"</p>
<p>"Anywhere."</p>
<p>"I will go at <i>my</i> hatter."</p>
<p>As the apothecary moved about his shop awaiting Raoul's return,
his own disaster became once more the subject of his anxiety. He
noticed that almost every person who passed looked in. "This is the
place,"--"That is the man,"--how plainly the glances of passers
sometimes speak! The people seemed, moreover, a little nervous.
Could even so little a city be stirred about such a petty, private
trouble as this of his? No; the city was having tribulations of its
own.</p>
<p>New Orleans was in that state of suppressed excitement which, in
later days, a frequent need of reassuring the outer world has
caused to be described by the phrase "never more peaceable." Raoul
perceived it before he had left the shop twenty paces behind. By
the time he reached the first corner he was in the swirl of the
popular current. He enjoyed it like a strong swimmer. He even drank
of it. It was better than wine and music mingled.</p>
<p>"Twelve weeks next Thursday, and no sign of re-cession!" said
one of two rapid walkers just in front of him. Their talk was in
the French of the province.</p>
<p>"Oh, re-cession!" exclaimed the other angrily. "The cession is a
reality. That, at least, we have got to swallow. Incredulity is
dead."</p>
<p>The first speaker's feelings could find expression only in
profanity.</p>
<p>"The cession--we wash our hands of it!" He turned partly around
upon his companion, as they hurried along, and gave his hands a
vehement dry washing. "If Incredulity is dead, Non-participation
reigns in its stead, and Discontent is prime minister!" He
brandished his fist as they turned a corner.</p>
<p>"If we must change, let us be subjects of the First Consul!"
said one of another pair whom Raoul met on a crossing.</p>
<p>There was a gathering of boys and vagabonds at the door of a
gun-shop. A man inside was buying a gun. That was all.</p>
<p>A group came out of a "coffee-house." The leader turned about
upon the rest:</p>
<p>"<i>Ah, bah! cette</i> Amayrican libetty!"</p>
<p>"See! see! it is this way!" said another of the number, taking
two others by their elbows, to secure an audience, "we shall do
nothing ourselves; we are just watching that vile Congress. It is
going to tear the country all to bits!"</p>
<p>"Ah, my friend, you haven't got the <i>inside</i> news," said
still another--Raoul lingered to hear him--"Louisiana is going to
state her wants! We have the liberty of free speech and are going
to use it!"</p>
<p>His information was correct; Louisiana, no longer incredulous of
her Americanization, had laid hold of her new liberties and was
beginning to run with them, like a boy dragging his kite over the
clods. She was about to state her wants, he said.</p>
<p>"And her don't-wants," volunteered one whose hand Raoul shook
heartily. "We warn the world. If Congress doesn't take heed, we
will not be responsible for the consequences!"</p>
<p>Raoul's hatter was full of the subject. As Mr. Innerarity
entered, he was saying good-day to a customer in his native tongue,
English, and so continued:</p>
<p>"Yes, under Spain we had a solid, quiet government--Ah! Mr.
Innerarity, overjoyed to see you! We were speaking of these
political troubles. I wish we might see the last of them. It's a
terrible bad mess; corruption to-day--I tell you what--it will be
disruption to-morrow. Well, it is no work of ours; we shall merely
stand off and see it."</p>
<p>"Mi-frien'," said Raoul, with mingled pity and superiority, "you
haven't got doze <i>inside</i> nooz; Louisiana is goin' to state
w'at she want."</p>
<p>On his way back toward the shop Mr. Innerarity easily learned
Louisiana's wants and don't-wants by heart. She wanted a Creole
governor; she did not want Casa Calvo invited to leave the country;
she wanted the provisions of the Treaty of Cession hurried up; "as
soon as possible," that instrument said; she had waited long
enough; she did not want "dat trile bi-ju'y"--execrable trash! she
wanted an <i>unwatched import trade!</i> she did not want a single
additional Am&eacute;ricain appointed to office; she wanted the
slave trade.</p>
<p>Just in sight of the bareheaded and anxious Frowenfeld, Raoul
let himself be stopped by a friend.</p>
<p>The remark was exchanged that the times were exciting.</p>
<p>"And yet," said the friend, "the city was never more peaceable.
It is exasperating to see that coward governor looking so
diligently after his police and hurrying on the organization of the
Am&eacute;ricain volunteer militia!" He pointed savagely here and
there. "M. Innerarity, I am lost in admiration at the all but
craven patience with which our people endure their wrongs! Do my
pistols show <i>too</i> much through my coat? Well, good-day; I
must go home and clean my gun; my dear friend, one don't know how
soon he may have to encounter the Recorder and Register of
Land-titles."</p>
<p>Raoul finished his errand.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', excuse me--I take dat lett' to 'Polyte for
you if you want." There are times when mere shopkeeping--any
peaceful routine--is torture.</p>
<p>But the apothecary felt so himself; he declined his assistant's
offer and went out toward the Veau-qui-t&ecirc;te.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<h3>FROWENFELD FINDS SYLVESTRE</h3>
<br>
<p>The Veau-qui-t&ecirc;te restaurant occupied the whole ground
floor of a small, low, two-story, tile-roofed, brick-and-stucco
building which still stands on the corner of Chartres and St. Peter
streets, in company with the well-preserved old Cabildo and the
young Cathedral, reminding one of the shabby and swarthy Creoles
whom we sometimes see helping better-kept kinsmen to murder time on
the banquettes of the old French Quarter. It was a favorite
rendezvous of the higher classes, convenient to the court-rooms and
municipal bureaus. There you found the choicest legal and political
gossips, with the best the market afforded of meat and drink.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld found a considerable number of persons there. He had
to move about among them to some extent, to make sure he was not
overlooking the object of his search.</p>
<p>As he entered the door, a man sitting near it stopped talking,
gazed rudely as he passed, and then leaned across the table and
smiled and murmured to his companion. The subject of his jest felt
their four eyes on his back.</p>
<p>There was a loud buzz of conversation throughout the room, but
wherever he went a wake of momentary silence followed him, and once
or twice he saw elbows nudged. He perceived that there was
something in the state of mind of these good citizens that made the
present sight of him particularly discordant.</p>
<p>Four men, leaning or standing at a small bar, were talking
excitedly in the Creole patois. They made frequent anxious, yet
amusedly defiant, mention of a certain <i>Pointe Canadienne</i>. It
was a portion of the Mississippi River "coast" not far above New
Orleans, where the merchants of the city met the smugglers who came
up from the Gulf by way of Barrataria Bay and Bayou. These four men
did not call it by the proper title just given; there were
commercial gentlemen in the Creole city, Englishmen, Scotchmen,
Yankees, as well as French and Spanish Creoles, who in public
indignantly denied, and in private tittered over, their complicity
with the pirates of Grand Isle, and who knew their trading
rendezvous by the sly nickname of "Little Manchac." As Frowenfeld
passed these four men they, too, ceased speaking and looked after
him, three with offensive smiles and one with a stare of
contempt.</p>
<p>Farther on, some Creoles were talking rapidly to an
Am&eacute;ricain, in English.</p>
<p>"And why?" one was demanding. "Because money is scarce. Under
other governments we had any quantity!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the venturesome Am&eacute;ricain in retort, "such as
it was; <i>assignats, liberanzas, bons</i>--Claiborne will give us
better money than that when he starts his bank."</p>
<p>"Hah! his bank, yes! John Law once had a bank, too; ask my old
father. What do we want with a bank? Down with banks!" The speaker
ceased; he had not finished, but he saw the apothecary. Frowenfeld
heard a muttered curse, an inarticulate murmur, and then a loud
burst of laughter.</p>
<p>A tall, slender young Creole whom he knew, and who had always
been greatly pleased to exchange salutations, brushed against him
without turning his eyes.</p>
<p>"You know," he was saying to a companion, "everybody in
Louisiana is to be a citizen, except the negroes and mules; that is
the kind of liberty they give us--all eat out of one trough."</p>
<p>"What we want," said a dark, ill-looking, but finely-dressed
man, setting his claret down, "and what we have got to have,
is"--he was speaking in French, but gave the want in
English--"Representesh'n wizout Taxa--" There his eye fell upon
Frowenfeld and followed him with a scowl.</p>
<p>"Mah frang," he said to his table companion, "wass you sink of a
mane w'at hask-a one neegrow to 'ave-a one shair wiz 'im, eh?--in
ze sem room?"</p>
<p>The apothecary found that his fame was far wider and more
general than he had supposed. He turned to go out, bowing as he did
so, to an Am&eacute;ricain merchant with whom he had some
acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Sir?" asked the merchant, with severe politeness, "wish to see
me? I thought you--As I was saying, gentlemen, what, after all,
does it sum up?"</p>
<p>A Creole interrupted him with an answer:</p>
<p>"Leetegash'n, Spoleeash'n, Pahtitsh'n, Disintegrhash'n!"</p>
<p>The voice was like Honor&eacute;'s. Frowenfeld looked; it was
Agamemnon Grandissime.</p>
<p>"I must go to Maspero's," thought the apothecary, and he started
up the rue Chartres. As he turned into the rue St. Louis, he
suddenly found himself one of a crowd standing before a
newly-posted placard, and at a glance saw it to be one of the
inflammatory publications which were a feature of the times,
appearing both daily and nightly on walls and fences.</p>
<p>"One Amerry-can pull' it down, an' Camille Brahmin 'e pas'e it
back," said a boy at Frowenfeld's side.</p>
<p>Exchange Alley was once <i>Passage de la Bourse</i>, and led
down (as it now does to the State House--late St. Louis Hotel) to
an establishment which seems to have served for a long term of
years as a sort of merchants' and auctioneers' coffee-house, with a
minimum of china and a maximum of glass: Maspero's--certainly
Maspero's as far back as 1810, and, we believe, Maspero's the day
the apothecary entered it, March 9, 1804. It was a livelier spot
than the Veau-qui-t&ecirc;te; it was to that what commerce is to
litigation, what standing and quaffing is to sitting and sipping.
Whenever the public mind approached that sad state of public
sentiment in which sanctity signs politicians' memorials and
chivalry breaks into the gun-shops, a good place to feel the thump
of the machinery was in Maspero's.</p>
<p>The first man Frowenfeld saw as he entered was M. Valentine
Grandissime. There was a double semicircle of gazers and listeners
in front of him; he was talking, with much show of unconcern, in
Creole French.</p>
<p>"Policy? I care little about policy." He waved his hand. "I know
my rights--and Louisiana's. We have a right to our opinions. We
have"--with a quiet smile and an upward turn of his extended
palm--"a right to protect them from the attack of interlopers, even
if we have to use gunpowder. I do not propose to abridge the
liberties of even this army of fortune-hunters. <i>Let</i> them
think." He half laughed. "Who cares whether they share our opinions
or not? Let them have their own. I had rather they would. But let
them hold their tongues. Let them remember they are Yankees. Let
them remember they are unbidden guests." All this without the least
warmth.</p>
<p>But the answer came aglow with passion, from one of the
semicircle, whom two or three seemed disposed to hold in check. It
also was in French, but the apothecary was astonished to hear his
own name uttered.</p>
<p>"But this fellow Frowenfeld"--the speaker did not see
Joseph--"has never held his tongue. He has given us good reason
half a dozen times, with his too free speech and his high moral
whine, to hang him with the lamppost rope! And now, when we have
borne and borne and borne and borne with him, and he shows up, all
at once, in all his rottenness, you say let him alone! One would
think you were defending Honor&eacute; Grandissime!" The back of
one of the speaker's hands fluttered in the palm of the other.</p>
<p>Valentine smiled.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute; Grandissime? Boy, you do not know what you are
talking about. Not Honor&eacute;, ha, ha! A man who, upon his own
avowal, is guilty of affiliating with the Yankees. A man whom we
have good reason to suspect of meditating his family's dishonor and
embarrassment!" Somebody saw the apothecary and laid a cautionary
touch on Valentine's arm, but he brushed it off. "As for Professor
Frowenfeld, he must defend himself."</p>
<p>"Ha-a-a-ah!"--a general cry of derision from the listeners.</p>
<p>"Defend himself!" exclaimed their spokesman; "shall I tell you
again what he is?" In his vehemence, the speaker wagged his chin
and held his clenched fists stiffly toward the floor. "He is--he
is--he is--"</p>
<p>He paused, breathing like a fighting dog. Frowenfeld, large,
white, and immovable, stood close before him.</p>
<p>"Dey 'ad no bizniz led 'im come oud to-day," said a bystander,
edging toward a pillar.</p>
<p>The Creole, a small young man not unknown to us, glared upon the
apothecary; but Frowenfeld was far above his blushing mood, and was
not disconcerted. This exasperated the Creole beyond bound; he made
a sudden, angry change of attitude, and demanded:</p>
<p>"Do you interrup' two gen'lemen in dey conve'sition, you Yankee
clown? Do you igno' dad you 'ave insult me, off-scow'ing?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's first response was a stern gaze. When he spoke, he
said:</p>
<p>"Sir, I am not aware that I have ever offered you the slightest
injury or affront; if you wish to finish your conversation with
this gentleman, I will wait till you are through."</p>
<p>The Creole bowed, as a knight who takes up the gage. He turned
to Valentine.</p>
<p>"Valentine, I was sayin' to you dad diz pusson is a cowa'd and a
sneak; I repead thad! I repead id! I spurn you! Go f'om yeh!"</p>
<p>The apothecary stood like a cliff.</p>
<p>It was too much for Creole forbearance. His adversary, with a
long snarl of oaths, sprang forward and with a great sweep of his
arm slapped the apothecary on the cheek. And then--</p>
<p>What a silence!</p>
<p>Frowenfeld had advanced one step; his opponent stood half turned
away, but with his face toward the face he had just struck and his
eyes glaring up into the eyes of the apothecary. The semicircle was
dissolved, and each man stood in neutral isolation, motionless and
silent. For one instant objects lost all natural proportion, and to
the expectant on-lookers the largest thing in the room was the big,
upraised, white fist of Frowenfeld. But in the next--how was this?
Could it be that that fist had not descended?</p>
<p>The imperturbable Valentine, with one preventing arm laid across
the breast of the expected victim and an open hand held
restrainingly up for truce, stood between the two men and said:</p>
<p>"Professor Frowenfeld--one moment--"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's face was ashen.</p>
<p>"Don't speak, sir!" he exclaimed. "If I attempt to parley I
shall break every bone in his body. Don't speak! I can guess your
explanation--he is drunk. But take him away."</p>
<p>Valentine, as sensible as cool, assisted by the kinsman who had
laid a hand on his arm, shuffled his enraged companion out.
Frowenfeld's still swelling anger was so near getting the better of
him that he unconsciously followed a quick step or two; but as
Valentine looked back and waved him to stop, he again stood
still.</p>
<p>"<i>Professeur</i>--you know,--" said a stranger, "daz Sylvestre
Grandissime."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld rather spoke to himself than answered:</p>
<p>"If I had not known that, I should have--" He checked himself
and left the place.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>While the apothecary was gathering these experiences, the free
spirit of Raoul Innerarity was chafing in the shop like an eagle in
a hen-coop. One moment after another brought him straggling
evidences, now of one sort, now of another, of the "never more
peaceable" state of affairs without. If only some pretext could be
conjured up, plausible or flimsy, no matter; if only some man would
pass with a gun on his shoulder, were it only a blow-gun; or if his
employer were any one but his beloved Frowenfeld, he would clap up
the shutters as quickly as he had already done once to-day, and be
off to the wars. He was just trying to hear imaginary pistol-shots
down toward the Place d'Armes, when the apothecary returned.</p>
<p>"D' you fin' him?"</p>
<p>"I found Sylvestre."</p>
<p>"'E took de lett'?"</p>
<p>"I did not offer it." Frowenfeld, in a few compact sentences,
told his adventure.</p>
<p>Raoul was ablaze with indignation.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', gimmy dat lett'!" He extended his pretty
hand.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld pondered.</p>
<p>"Gimmy 'er!" persisted the artist; "befo' I lose de sight from
dat lett' she goin' to be hanswer by Sylvestre Grandissime, an' 'e
goin' to wrat you one appo-logie! Oh! I goin' mek 'im crah fo'
shem!"</p>
<p>"If I could know you would do only as I--"</p>
<p>"I do it!" cried Raoul, and sprang for his hat; and in the end
Frowenfeld let him have his way.</p>
<p>"I had intended seeing him--" the apothecary said.</p>
<p>"Nevvamine to see; I goin' tell him!" cried Raoul, as he crowded
his hat fiercely down over his curls and plunged out.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<h3>TO COME TO THE POINT</h3>
<br>
<p>It was equally a part of Honor&eacute; Grandissime's nature and
of his art as a merchant to wear a look of serene leisure. With
this look on his face he re&euml;ntered his counting-room after his
morning visit to Frowenfeld's shop. He paused a moment outside the
rail, gave the weak-eyed gentleman who presided there a quiet
glance equivalent to a beckon, and, as that person came near,
communicated two or three items of intelligence or instruction
concerning office details, by which that invaluable diviner of
business meanings understood that he wished to be let alone for an
hour. Then M. Grandissime passed on into his private office, and,
shutting the door behind him, walked briskly to his desk and sat
down.</p>
<p>He dropped his elbows upon a broad paper containing some
recently written, unfinished memoranda that included figures in
column, cast his eyes quite around the apartment, and then covered
his face with his palms--a gesture common enough for a tired man of
business in a moment of seclusion; but just as the face disappeared
in the hands, the look of serene leisure gave place to one of great
mental distress. The paper under his elbows, to the consideration
of which he seemed about to return, was in the handwriting of his
manager, with additions by his own pen. Earlier in the day he had
come to a pause in the making of these additions, and, after one or
two vain efforts to proceed, had laid down his pen, taken his hat,
and gone to see the unlucky apothecary. Now he took up the broken
thread. To come to a decision; that was the task which forced from
him his look of distress. He drew his face slowly through his
palms, set his lips, cast up his eyes, knit his knuckles, and then
opened and struck his palms together, as if to say: "Now, come; let
me make up my mind."</p>
<p>There may be men who take every moral height at a dash; but to
the most of us there must come moments when our wills can but just
rise and walk in their sleep. Those who in such moments wait for
clear views find, when the issue is past, that they were only
yielding to the devil's chloroform.</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; Grandissme bent his eyes upon the paper. But he
saw neither its figures nor its words. The interrogation,
"Surrender Fausse Rivi&egrave;re?" appeared to hang between his
eyes and the paper, and when his resolution tried to answer "Yes,"
he saw red flags; he heard the auctioneer's drum; he saw his
kinsmen handing house-keys to strangers; he saw the old servants of
the great family standing in the marketplace; he saw kinswomen
pawning their plate; he saw his clerks (Brahmins, Mandarins,
Grandissimes) standing idle and shabby in the arcade of the Cabildo
and on the banquettes of Maspero's and the Veau-qui-t&ecirc;te; he
saw red-eyed young men in the Exchange denouncing a man who, they
said, had, ostensibly for conscience's sake, but really for love,
forced upon the woman he had hoped to marry a fortune filched from
his own kindred. He saw the junto of doctors in Frowenfeld's door
charitably deciding him insane; he saw the more vengeful of his
family seeking him with half-concealed weapons; he saw himself shot
at in the rue Royale, in the rue Toulouse, and in the Place
d'Armes: and, worst of all, missed.</p>
<p>But he wiped his forehead, and the writing on the paper became,
in a measure, visible. He read:</p>
<blockquote>Total mortgages on the lands of all the Grandissimes
$--<br>
Total present value of same, titles at buyers' risk --<br>
Cash, goods, and accounts --<br>
Fausse Rivi&egrave;re Plantation account --</blockquote>
<p>There were other items, but he took up the edge of the paper
mechanically, pushed it slowly away from him, leaned back in his
chair and again laid his hands upon his face.</p>
<p>"Suppose I retain Fausse Rivi&egrave;re," he said to himself, as
if he had not said it many times before.</p>
<p>Then he saw memoranda that were not on any paper before
him--such a mortgage to be met on such a date; so much from Fausse
Rivi&egrave;re Plantation account retained to protect that mortgage
from foreclosure; such another to be met on such a date--so much
more of same account to protect it. He saw Aurora and Clotilde
Nancanou, with anguished faces, offering woman's pleadings to deaf
constables. He saw the remainder of Aurora's plantation account
thrown to the lawyers to keep the question of the Grandissime
titles languishing in the courts. He saw the fortunes of his clan
rallied meanwhile and coming to the rescue, himself and kindred
growing independent of questionable titles, and even Fausse
Rivi&egrave;re Plantation account restored, but Aurora and Clotilde
nowhere to be found. And then he saw the grave, pale face of Joseph
Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>He threw himself forward, drew the paper nervously toward him,
and stared at the figures. He began at the first item and went over
the whole paper, line by line, testing every extension, proving
every addition, noting if possibly any transposition of figures had
been made and overlooked, if something was added that should have
been subtracted, or subtracted that should have been added. It was
like a prisoner trying the bars of his cell.</p>
<p>Was there no way to make things happen differently? Had he not
overlooked some expedient? Was not some financial manoeuvre
possible which might compass both desired ends? He left his chair
and walked up and down, as Joseph at that very moment was doing in
the room where he had left him, came back, looked at the paper, and
again walked up and down. He murmured now and then to himself:
"<i>Self</i>-denial--that is not the hard work. Penniless
myself--<i>that</i> is play," and so on. He turned by and by and
stood looking up at that picture of the man in the cuirass which
Aurora had once noticed. He looked at it, but he did not see it. He
was thinking--"Her rent is due to-morrow. She will never believe I
am not her landlord. She will never go to my half-brother." He
turned once more and mentally beat his breast as he muttered: "Why
do I not decide?"</p>
<p>Somebody touched the doorknob. Honor&eacute; stepped forward and
opened it. It was a mortgager.</p>
<p>"<i>Ah! entrez, Monsieur</i>."</p>
<p>He retained the visitor's hand, leading him in and talking
pleasantly in French until both had found chairs. The conversation
continued in that tongue through such pointless commercial gossip
as this:</p>
<p>"So the brig <i>Equinox</i> is aground at the head of the
Passes," said M. Grandissime.</p>
<p>"I have just heard she is off again."</p>
<p>"Aha?"</p>
<p>"Yes; the Fort Plaquemine canoe is just up from below. I
understand John McDonough has bought the entire cargo of the
schooner <i>Freedom</i>."</p>
<p>"No, not all; Blanque et Fils bought some twenty boys and women
out of the lot. Where is she lying?"</p>
<p>"Right at the head of the Basin."</p>
<p>And much more like this; but by and by the mortgager came to the
point with the casual remark:</p>
<p>"The excitement concerning land titles seems to increase rather
than subside."</p>
<p>"They must have <i>something</i> to be excited about, I
suppose," said M. Grandissime, crossing his legs and smiling. It
was tradesman's talk.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the other; "there seems to be an idea current
to-day that all holders under Spanish titles are to be immediately
dispossessed, without even process of court. I believe a very
slight indiscretion on the part of the Governor-General would
precipitate a riot."</p>
<p>"He will not commit any," said M. Grandissime with a quiet
gravity, changing his manner to that of one who draws upon a
reserve of private information. "There will be no outbreak."</p>
<p>"I suppose not. We do not know, really, that the American
Congress will throw any question upon titles; but still--"</p>
<p>"What are some of the shrewdest Americans among us doing?" asked
M. Grandissime.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the mortgager, "it is true they are buying these
very titles; but they may be making a mistake?"</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the speaker, he allowed his face an expression
of argumentative shrewdness as he completed this sentence, and M.
Grandissime, the merchant, caught an instantaneous full view of his
motive; he wanted to buy. He was a man whose known speculative
policy was to "go in" in moments of panic.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime was again face to face with the question of the
morning. To commence selling must be to go on selling. This, as a
plan, included restitution to Aurora; but it meant also dissolution
to the Grandissimes, for should their <i>sold</i> titles be
pronounced bad, then the titles of other lands would be bad; many
an asset among M. Grandissime's memoranda would shrink into
nothing, and the meagre proceeds of the Grandissime estates, left
to meet the strain without the aid of Aurora's accumulated fortune,
would founder in a sea of liabilities; while should these titles,
after being parted with, turn out good, his incensed kindred,
shutting their eyes to his memoranda and despising his exhibits,
would see in him only the family traitor, and he would go about the
streets of his town the subject of their implacable denunciation,
the community's obloquy, and Aurora's cold evasion. So much, should
he sell. On the other hand, to decline to sell was to enter upon
that disingenuous scheme of delays which would enable him to avail
himself and his people of that favorable wind and tide of fortune
which the Cession had brought. Thus the estates would be lost, if
lost at all, only when the family could afford to lose them, and
Honor&eacute; Grandissime would continue to be Honor&eacute; the
Magnificent, the admiration of the city and the idol of his clan.
But Aurora--and Clotilde--would have to eat the crust of poverty,
while their fortunes, even in his hands, must bear all the jeopardy
of the scheme. That was all. Retain Fausse Rivi&egrave;re and its
wealth, and save the Grandissimes; surrender Fausse Rivi&egrave;re,
let the Grandissime estates go, and save the Nancanous. That was
the whole dilemma.</p>
<p>"Let me see," said M. Grandissime. "You have a mortgage on one
of our Golden Coast plantations. Well, to be frank with you, I was
thinking of that when you came in. You know I am partial to prompt
transactions--I thought of offering you either to take up that
mortgage or to sell you the plantation, as you may prefer. I have
ventured to guess that it would suit you to own it."</p>
<p>And the speaker felt within him a secret exultation in the idea
that he had succeeded in throwing the issue off upon a Providence
that could control this mortgager's choice.</p>
<p>"I would prefer to leave that choice with you," said the coy
would-be purchaser; and then the two went coquetting again for
another moment.</p>
<p>"I understand that Nicholas Girod is proposing to erect a
four-story brick building on the corner of Royale and St. Pierre.
Do you think it practicable? Do you think our soil will support
such a structure?"</p>
<p>"Pitot thinks it will. Bor&eacute; says it is perfectly
feasible."</p>
<p>So they dallied.</p>
<p>"Well," said the mortgager, presently rising, "you will make up
your mind and let me know, will you?"</p>
<p>The chance repetition of those words "make up your mind" touched
Honor&eacute; Grandissime like a hot iron. He rose with the
visitor.</p>
<p>"Well, sir, what would you give us for our title in case we
should decide to part with it?"</p>
<p>The two men moved slowly, side by side, toward the door, and in
the half-open doorway, after a little further trifling, the title
was sold.</p>
<p>"Well, good-day," said M. Grandissime. "M. de Brahmin will
arrange the papers for us to-morrow."</p>
<p>He turned back toward his private desk.</p>
<p>"And now," thought he, "I am acting without resolving. No merit;
no strength of will; no clearness of purpose; no emphatic decision;
nothing but a yielding to temptation."</p>
<p>And M. Grandissime spoke truly; but it is only whole men who so
yield--yielding to the temptation to do right.</p>
<p>He passed into the counting-room, to M. De Brahmin, and standing
there talked in an inaudible tone, leaning over the upturned
spectacles of his manager, for nearly an hour. Then, saying he
would go to dinner, he went out. He did not dine at home nor at the
Veau-qui-t&ecirc;te, nor at any of the clubs; so much is known; he
merely disappeared for two or three hours and was not seen again
until late in the afternoon, when two or three Brahmins and
Grandissimes, wandering about in search of him, met him on the
levee near the head of the rue Bienville, and with an exclamation
of wonder and a look of surprise at his dusty shoes, demanded to
know where he had hid himself while they had been ransacking the
town in search of him.</p>
<p>"We want you to tell us what you will do about our titles."</p>
<p>He smiled pleasantly, the picture of serenity, and replied:</p>
<p>"I have not fully made up my mind yet; as soon as I do so I will
let you know."</p>
<p>There was a word or two more exchanged, and then, after a moment
of silence, with a gentle "Eh, bien," and a gesture to which they
were accustomed, he stepped away backward, they resumed their
hurried walk and talk, and he turned into the rue Bienville.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII"></a>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
<h3>AN INHERITANCE OF WRONG</h3>
<br>
<p>"I tell you," Doctor Keene used to say, "that old woman's a
thinker." His allusion was to Clemence, the <i>marchande des
calas</i>. Her mental activity was evinced not more in the cunning
aptness of her songs than in the droll wisdom of her sayings. Not
the melody only, but the often audacious, epigrammatic philosophy
of her tongue as well, sold her <i>calas</i> and gingercakes.</p>
<p>But in one direction her wisdom proved scant. She presumed too
much on her insignificance. She was a "study," the gossiping circle
at Frowenfeld's used to say; and any observant hearer of her odd
aphorisms could see that she herself had made a life-study of
herself and her conditions; but she little thought that
others--some with wits and some with none--young hare-brained
Grandissimes, Mandarins and the like--were silently, and for her
most unluckily, charging their memories with her knowing speeches;
and that of every one of those speeches she would ultimately have
to give account.</p>
<p>Doctor Keene, in the old days of his health, used to enjoy an
occasional skirmish with her. Once, in the course of chaffering
over the price of <i>calas</i>, he enounced an old current
conviction which is not without holders even to this day; for we
may still hear it said by those who will not be decoyed down from
the mountain fastnesses of the old Southern doctrines, that their
slaves were "the happiest people under the sun." Clemence had made
bold to deny this with argumentative indignation, and was
courteously informed in retort that she had promulgated a falsehood
of magnitude.</p>
<p>"W'y, Mawse Chawlie," she replied, "does you s'pose one po'
nigga kin tell a big lie? No, sah! But w'en de whole people tell
w'at ain' so--if dey know it, aw if dey don' know it--den dat
<i>is</i> a big lie!" And she laughed to contortion.</p>
<p>"What is that you say?" he demanded, with mock ferocity. "You
charge white people with lying?"</p>
<p>"Oh, sakes, Mawse Chawlie, no! De people don't mek up dat ah; de
debble pass it on 'em. Don' you know de debble ah de grett
cyount'-feiteh? Ev'y piece o' money he mek he tek an' put some
debblemen' on de under side, an' one o' his pootiess lies on top;
an' 'e gilt dat lie, and 'e rub dat lie on 'is elbow, an' 'e shine
dat lie, an' 'e put 'is bess licks on dat lie; entel ev'ybody say:
'Oh, how pooty!' An' dey tek it fo' good money, yass--and pass it!
Dey b'lieb it!"</p>
<p>"Oh," said some one at Doctor Keene's side, disposed to quiz,
"you niggers don't know when you are happy."</p>
<p>"Dass so, Mawse--<i>c'est vrai, oui</i>!" she answered quickly:
"we donno no mo'n white folks!"</p>
<p>The laugh was against him.</p>
<p>"Mawse Chawlie," she said again, "w'a's dis I yeh 'bout dat
Eu'ope country? 's dat true de niggas is all free in Eu'ope!"</p>
<p>Doctor Keene replied that something like that was true.</p>
<p>"Well, now, Mawse Chawlie, I gwan t' ass you a riddle. If dat is
<i>so</i>, den fo' w'y I yeh folks bragg'n 'bout de 'stayt o'
s'iety in Eu'ope'?"</p>
<p>The mincing drollery with which she used this fine phrase
brought another peal of laughter. Nobody tried to guess.</p>
<p>"I gwan tell you," said the <i>marchande</i>; "'t is becyaze dey
got a 'fixed wuckin' class.'" She sputtered and giggled with the
general ha, ha. "Oh, ole Clemence kin talk proctah, yass!"</p>
<p>She made a gesture for attention.</p>
<p>"D' y' ebber yeh w'at de cya'ge-hoss say w'en 'e see de
cyaht-hoss tu'n loose in de sem pawstu'e wid he, an' knowed dat
some'ow de cyaht gotteh be haul'? W'y 'e jiz snawt an' kick up 'is
heel'"--she suited the action to the word--"an' tah' roun' de fiel'
an' prance up to de fence an' say: 'Whoopy! shoo! shoo! dis yeh
country gittin' <i>too</i> free!'"</p>
<p>"Oh," she resumed, as soon as she could be heard, "white folks
is werry kine. Dey wants us to b'lieb we happy--dey <i>wants to
b'lieb</i> we is. W'y, you know, dey 'bleeged to b'lieb it--fo' dey
own cyumfut. 'Tis de sem weh wid de preache's; dey buil' we ow own
sep'ate meet'n-houses; dey b'liebs us lak it de bess, an' dey
<i>knows</i> dey lak it de bess."</p>
<p>The laugh at this was mostly her own. It is not a laughable
sight to see the comfortable fractions of Christian communities
everywhere striving, with sincere, pious, well-meant, criminal
benevolence, to make their poor brethren contented with the ditch.
Nor does it become so to see these efforts meet, or seem to meet,
some degree of success. Happily man cannot so place his brother
that his misery will continue unmitigated. You may dwarf a man to
the mere stump of what he ought to be, and yet he will put out
green leaves. "Free from care," we benignly observe of the dwarfed
classes of society; but we forget, or have never thought, what a
crime we commit when we rob men and women of their cares.</p>
<p>To Clemence the order of society was nothing. No upheaval could
reach to the depth to which she was sunk. It is true, she was one
of the population. She had certain affections toward people and
places; but they were not of a consuming sort.</p>
<p>As for us, our feelings, our sentiments, affections, etc., are
fine and keen, delicate and many; what we call refined. Why?
Because we get them as we get our old swords and gems and
laces--from our grandsires, mothers, and all. Refined they
are--after centuries of refining. But the feelings handed down to
Clemence had come through ages of African savagery; through fires
that do not refine, but that blunt and blast and blacken and char;
starvation, gluttony, drunkenness, thirst, drowning, nakedness,
dirt, fetichism, debauchery, slaughter, pestilence and the
rest--she was their heiress; they left her the cinders of human
feelings. She remembered her mother. They had been separated in her
childhood, in Virginia when it was a province. She remembered, with
pride, the price her mother had brought at auction, and remarked,
as an additional interesting item, that she had never seen or heard
of her since. She had had children, assorted colors--had one with
her now, the black boy that brought the basil to Joseph; the others
were here and there, some in the Grandissime households or
field-gangs, some elsewhere within occasional sight, some dead,
some not accounted for. Husbands--like the Samaritan woman's. We
know she was a constant singer and laugher.</p>
<p>And so on that day, when Honor&eacute; Grandissime had advised
the Governor-General of Louisiana to be very careful to avoid
demonstration of any sort if he wished to avert a street war in his
little capital, Clemence went up one street and down another,
singing her song and laughing her professional merry laugh. How
could it be otherwise? Let events take any possible turn, how could
it make any difference to Clemence? What could she hope to gain?
What could she fear to lose? She sold some of her goods to Casa
Calvo's Spanish guard and sang them a Spanish song; some to
Claiborne's soldiers and sang them Yankee Doodle with unclean words
of her own inspiration, which evoked true soldiers' laughter; some
to a priest at his window, exchanging with him a pious comment or
two upon the wickedness of the times generally and their
Am&eacute;ricain Protestant-poisoned community in particular; and
(after going home to dinner and coming out newly furnished) she
sold some more of her wares to the excited groups of Creoles to
which we have had occasion to allude, and from whom, insensible as
she was to ribaldry, she was glad to escape. The day now drawing to
a close, she turned her steps toward her wonted crouching-place,
the willow avenue on the levee, near the Place d'Armes. But she had
hardly defined this decision clearly in her mind, and had but just
turned out of the rue St. Louis, when her song attracted an ear in
a second-story room under whose window she was passing. As usual,
it was fitted to the passing event:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Apportez moi mo' sabre,<br>
Ba boum, ba boum, boum, boum</i>."</blockquote>
<p>"Run, fetch that girl here," said Dr. Keene to the slave woman
who had just entered his room with a pitcher of water.</p>
<p>"Well, old eavesdropper," he said, as Clemence came, "what is
the scandal to-day?"</p>
<p>Clemence laughed.</p>
<p>"You know, Mawse Chawlie, I dunno noth'n' 'tall 'bout nobody.
I'se a nigga w'at mine my own business."</p>
<p>"Sit down there on that stool, and tell me what is going on
outside."</p>
<p>"I d' no noth'n' 'bout no goin's on; got no time fo' sit down,
me; got sell my cakes. I don't goin' git mix' in wid no white
folks's doin's."</p>
<p>"Hush, you old hypocrite; I will buy all your cakes. Put them
out there on the table."</p>
<p>The invalid, sitting up in bed, drew a purse from behind his
pillow and tossed her a large price. She tittered, courtesied and
received the money.</p>
<p>"Well, well, Mawse Chawlie, 'f you ain' de funni'st gen'leman I
knows, to be sho!"</p>
<p>"Have you seen Joseph Frowenfeld to-day?" he asked.</p>
<p>"He, he, he! W'at I got do wid Mawse Frowenfel'? I goes on de
off side o' sich folks--folks w'at cann' 'have deyself no bette'n
dat--he, he, he! At de same time I did happen, jis chancin' by
accident, to see 'im."</p>
<p>"How is he?"</p>
<p>Dr. Keene made plain by his manner that any sensational account
would receive his instantaneous contempt, and she answered within
bounds.</p>
<p>"Well, now, tellin' the simple trufe, he ain' much hurt."</p>
<p>The doctor turned slowly and cautiously in bed.</p>
<p>"Have you seen Honor&eacute; Grandissime?"</p>
<p>"W'y--das funny you ass me dat. I jis now see 'im dis werry
minnit."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Jis gwine into de house wah dat laydy live w'at 'e runned over
dat ah time."</p>
<p>"Now, you old hag," cried the sick man, his weak, husky voice
trembling with passion, "you know you're telling me a lie."</p>
<p>"No, Mawse Chawlie," she protested with a coward's frown, "I
swah I tellin' you de God's trufe!"</p>
<p>"Hand me my clothes off that chair."</p>
<p>"Oh! but, Mawse Chawlie--"</p>
<p>The little doctor cursed her. She did as she was bid, and made
as if to leave the room.</p>
<p>"Don't you go away."</p>
<p>"But Mawse Chawlie, you' undress'--he, he!"</p>
<p>She was really abashed and half frightened.</p>
<p>"I know that; and you have got to help me put my clothes
on."</p>
<p>"You gwan kill yo'se'f, Mawse Chawlie," she said, handling a
garment.</p>
<p>"Hold your black tongue."</p>
<p>She dressed him hastily, and he went down the stairs of his
lodging-house and out into the street. Clemence went in search of
her master.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII"></a>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>
<h3>THE EAGLE VISITS THE DOVES IN THEIR NEST</h3>
<br>
<p>Alphonsina--only living property of Aurora and Clotilde--was
called upon to light a fire in the little parlor. Elsewhere,
although the day was declining, few persons felt such a need; but
in No. 19 rue Bienville there were two chilling influences combined
requiring an artificial offset. One was the ground under the floor,
which was only three inches distant, and permanently saturated with
water; the other was despair.</p>
<p>Before this fire the two ladies sat down together like watchers,
in that silence and vacuity of mind which come after an exhaustive
struggle ending in the recognition of the inevitable; a torpor of
thought, a stupefaction of feeling, a purely negative state of
joylessness sequent to the positive state of anguish. They were now
both hungry, but in want of some present friend acquainted with the
motions of mental distress who could guess this fact and press them
to eat. By their eyes it was plain they had been weeping much; by
the subdued tone, too, of their short and infrequent speeches.</p>
<p>Alphonsina, having made the fire, went out with a bundle. It was
Aurora's last good dress. She was going to try to sell it.</p>
<p>"It ought not to be so hard," began Clotilde, in a quiet manner
of contemplating some one else's difficulty, but paused with the
saying uncompleted, and sighed under her breath.</p>
<p>"But it <i>is</i> so hard," responded Aurora.</p>
<p>"No, it ought not to be so hard--"</p>
<p>"How, not so hard?"</p>
<p>"It is not so hard to live," said Clotilde; "but it is hard to
be ladies. You understand--" she knit her fingers, dropped them
into her lap and turned her eyes toward Aurora, who responded with
the same motions, adding the crossing of her silk-stockinged ankles
before the fire.</p>
<p>"No," said Aurora, with a scintillation of irrepressible
mischief in her eyes.</p>
<p>"After all," pursued Clotilde, "what troubles us is not how to
make a living, but how to get a living without making it."</p>
<p>"Ah! that would be magnificent!" said Aurora, and then added,
more soberly; "but we are compelled to make a living."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"No-o? Ah! what do you mean with your 'no'?"</p>
<p>"I mean it is just the contrary; we are compelled not to make a
living. Look at me: I can cook, but I must not cook; I am skillful
with the needle, but I must not take in sewing; I could keep
accounts; I could nurse the sick; but I must not. I could be a
confectioner, a milliner, a dressmaker, a vest-maker, a cleaner of
gloves and laces, a dyer, a bird-seller, a mattress-maker, an
upholsterer, a dancing-teacher, a florist--"</p>
<p>"Oh!" softly exclaimed Aurora, in English, "you could be--you
know w'ad?--an egcellen' drug-cl'--ah, ha, ha!"</p>
<p>"Now--"</p>
<p>But the threatened irruption was averted by a look of tender
apology from Aurora, in reply to one of martyrdom from
Clotilde.</p>
<p>"My angel daughter," said Aurora, "if society has decreed that
ladies must be ladies, then that is our first duty; our second is
to live. Do you not see why it is that this practical world does
not permit ladies to make a living? Because if they could, none of
them would ever consent to be married. Ha! women talk about
marrying for love; but society is too sharp to trust them, yet! It
makes it <i>necessary</i> to marry. I will tell you the honest
truth; some days when I get very, very hungry, and we have nothing
but rice--all because we are ladies without male protectors--I
think society could drive even me to marriage!--for your sake,
though, darling; of course, only for your sake!"</p>
<p>"Never!" replied Clotilde; "for my sake, never; for your own
sake if you choose. I should not care. I should be glad to see you
do so if it would make you happy; but never for my sake and never
for hunger's sake; but for love's sake, yes; and God bless thee,
pretty maman."</p>
<p>"Clotilde, dear," said the unconscionable widow, "let me assure
you, once for all,--starvation is preferable. I mean for me, you
understand, simply for me; that is my feeling on the subject."</p>
<p>Clotilde turned her saddened eyes with a steady scrutiny upon
her deceiver, who gazed upward in apparently unconscious reverie,
and sighed softly as she laid her head upon the high chair-back and
stretched out her feet.</p>
<p>"I wish Alphonsina would come back," she said. "Ah!" she added,
hearing a footfall on the step outside the street door, "there she
is."</p>
<p>She arose and drew the bolt. Unseen to her, the person whose
footsteps she had heard stood upon the doorstep with a hand lifted
to knock, but pausing to "makeup his mind." He heard the bolt shoot
back, recognized the nature of the mistake, and, feeling that here
again he was robbed of volition, rapped.</p>
<p>"That is not Alphonsina!"</p>
<p>The two ladies looked at each other and turned pale.</p>
<p>"But you must open it," whispered Clotilde, half rising.</p>
<p>Aurora opened the door, and changed from white to crimson.
Clotilde rose up quickly. The gentleman lifted his hat.</p>
<p>"Madame Nancanou."</p>
<p>"M. Grandissime?"</p>
<p>"Oui, Madame."</p>
<p>For once, Aurora was in an uncontrollable flutter. She
stammered, lost her breath, and even spoke worse French than she
needed to have done.</p>
<p>"Be pl--pleased, sir--to enter. Clotilde, my daughter--Monsieur
Grandissime. P-please be seated, sir. Monsieur Grandissime,"--she
dropped into a chair with an air of vivacity pitiful to behold,--"I
suppose you have come for the rent." She blushed even more
violently than before, and her hand stole upward upon her heart to
stay its violent beating. "Clotilde, dear, I should be glad if you
would put the fire before the screen; it is so much too warm." She
pushed her chair back and shaded her face with her hand. "I think
the warmer is growing weather outside, is it--is it not?"</p>
<p>The struggles of a wounded bird could not have been more
piteous. Monsieur Grandissime sought to speak. Clotilde, too,
nerved by the sight of her mother's embarrassment, came to her
support, and she and the visitor spoke in one breath.</p>
<p>"Maman, if Monsieur--pardon--"</p>
<p>"Madame Nancanou, the--pardon, Mademoiselle--"</p>
<p>"I have presumed to call upon you," resumed M. Grandissime,
addressing himself now to both ladies at once, "to see if I may
enlist you in a purely benevolent undertaking in the interest of
one who has been unfortunate--a common acquaintance--"</p>
<p>"Common acquaint--" interrupted Aurora, with a hostile lighting
of her eyes.</p>
<p>"I believe so--Professor Frowenfeld." M. Grandissme saw Clotilde
start, and in her turn falsely accuse the fire by shading her face:
but it was no time to stop. "Ladies," he continued, "please allow
me, for the sake of the good it may effect, to speak plainly and to
the point."</p>
<p>The ladies expressed acquiescence by settling themselves to
hear.</p>
<p>"Professor Frowenfeld had the extraordinary misfortune this
morning to incur the suspicion of having entered a house for the
purpose of--at least, for a bad design--"</p>
<p>"He is innocent!" came from Clotilde, against her intention;
Aurora covertly put out a hand, and Clotilde clutched it
nervously.</p>
<p>"As, for example, robbery," said the self-recovered Aurora,
ignoring Clotilde's look of protestation.</p>
<p>"Call it so," responded M. Grandissime. "Have you heard at whose
house this was?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"It was at the house of Palmyre Philosophe."</p>
<p>"Palmyre Philosophe!" exclaimed Aurora, in low astonishment.
Clotilde let slip, in a tone of indignant incredulity, a soft "Ah!"
Aurora turned, and with some hope that M. Grandissime would not
understand, ventured to say in Spanish, quietly:</p>
<p>"Come, come, this will never do."</p>
<p>And Clotilde replied in the same tongue:</p>
<p>"I know it, but he is innocent."</p>
<p>"Let us understand each other," said their visitor. "There is
not the faintest idea in the mind of one of us that Professor
Frowenfeld is guilty of even an intention of wrong; otherwise I
should not be here. He is a man simply incapable of anything
ignoble."</p>
<p>Clotilde was silent. Aurora answered promptly, with the air of
one not to be excelled in generosity:</p>
<p>"Certainly, he is very incapabl'."</p>
<p>"Still," resumed the visitor, turning especially to Clotilde,
"the known facts are these, according to his own statement: he was
in the house of Palmyre on some legitimate business which,
unhappily, he considers himself on some account bound not to
disclose, and by some mistake of Palmyre's old Congo woman, was set
upon by her and wounded, barely escaping with a whole skull into
the street, an object of public scandal. Laying aside the
consideration of his feelings, his reputation is at stake and
likely to be ruined unless the affair can be explained clearly and
satisfactorily, and at once, by his friends."</p>
<p>"And you undertake--" began Aurora.</p>
<p>"Madame Nancanou," said Honor&eacute; Grandissime, leaning
toward her earnestly, "you know--I must beg leave to appeal to your
candor and confidence--you know everything concerning Palmyre that
I know. You know me, and who I am; you know it is not for me to
undertake to confer with Palmyre. I know, too, her old affection
for you; she lives but a little way down this street upon which you
live; there is still daylight enough at your disposal; if you will,
you can go to see her, and get from her a full and complete
exoneration of this young man. She cannot come to you; she is not
fit to leave her room."</p>
<p>"Cannot leave her room?"</p>
<p>"I am, possibly, violating confidence in this disclosure, but it
is unavoidable--you have to know: she is not fully recovered from a
pistol-shot wound received between two and three weeks ago."</p>
<p>"Pistol-shot wound!"</p>
<p>Both ladies started forward with open lips and exclamations of
amazement.</p>
<p>"Received from a third person--not myself and not Professor
Frowenfeld--in a desperate attempt made by her to avenge the wrongs
which she has suffered, as you, Madam, as well as I, are aware, at
the hands of--"</p>
<p>Aurora rose up with a majestic motion for the speaker to
desist.</p>
<p>"If it is to mention the person of whom your allusion reminds
me, that you have honored us with a call this evening,
Monsieur--"</p>
<p>Her eyes were flashing as he had seen them flash in front of the
Place d'Armes.</p>
<p>"I beg you not to suspect me of meanness," he answered, gently,
and with a remonstrative smile. "I have been trying all day, in a
way unnecessary to explain, to be generous."</p>
<p>"I suppose you are incapabl'," said Aurora, following her double
meaning with that combination of mischievous eyes and unsmiling
face of which she was master. She resumed her seat, adding: "It is
generous for you to admit that Palmyre has suffered wrongs."</p>
<p>"It <i>would</i> be," he replied, "to attempt to repair them,
seeing that I am not responsible for them, but this I cannot claim
yet to have done. I have asked of you, Madam, a generous act. I
might ask another of you both jointly. It is to permit me to say
without offence, that there is one man, at least, of the name of
Grandissime who views with regret and mortification the yet deeper
wrongs which you are even now suffering."</p>
<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Aurora, inwardly ready for fierce tears, but
with no outward betrayal save a trifle too much grace and an
over-bright smile, "Monsieur is much mistaken; we are quite
comfortable and happy, wanting nothing, eh, Clotilde?--not even our
rights, ha, ha!"</p>
<p>She rose and let Alphonsina in. The bundle was still in the
negress's arms. She passed through the room and disappeared in the
direction of the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Oh! no, sir, not at all," repeated Aurora, as she once more sat
down.</p>
<p>"You ought to want your rights," said M. Grandissime. "You ought
to have them."</p>
<p>"You think so?"</p>
<p>Aurora was really finding it hard to conceal her growing
excitement, and turned, with a faint hope of relief, toward
Clotilde.</p>
<p>Clotilde, looking only at their visitor, but feeling her
mother's glance, with a tremulous and half-choked voice, said
eagerly:</p>
<p>"Then why do you not give them to us?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" interposed Aurora, "we shall get them to-morrow, when the
sheriff comes."</p>
<p>And, thereupon what did Clotilde do but sit bolt upright, with
her hands in her lap, and let the tears roll, tear after tear, down
her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur," said Aurora, smiling still, "those that you see
are really tears. Ha, ha, ha! excuse me, I really have to laugh;
for I just happened to remember our meeting at the masked ball last
September. We had such a pleasant evening and were so much indebted
to you for our enjoyment,--particularly myself,--little thinking,
you know, that you were one of that great family which believes we
ought to have our rights, you know. There are many people who ought
to have their rights. There was Bras-Coup&eacute;; indeed, he got
them--found them in the swamp. Maybe Clotilde and I shall find ours
in the street. When we unmasked in the theatre, you know, I did not
know you were my landlord, and you did not know that I could not
pay a few picayunes of rent. But you must excuse those tears;
Clotilde is generally a brave little woman, and would not be so
rude as to weep before a stranger; but she is weak to-day--we are
both weak to-day, from the fact that we have eaten nothing since
early morning, although we have abundance of food--for want of
appetite, you understand. You must sometimes be affected the same
way, having the care of so much wealth <i>of all sorts</i>."</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; Grandissime had risen to his feet and was standing
with one hand on the edge of the lofty mantel, his hat in the other
dropped at his side and his eye fixed upon Aurora's beautiful face,
whence her small nervous hand kept dashing aside the tears through
which she defiantly talked and smiled. Clotilde sat with clenched
hands buried in her lap, looking at Aurora and still weeping.</p>
<p>And M. Grandissime was saying to himself:</p>
<p>"If I do this thing now--if I do it here--I do it on an impulse;
I do it under constraint of woman's tears; I do it because I love
this woman; I do it to get out of a corner; I do it in weakness,
not in strength; I do it without having made up my mind whether or
not it is the best thing to do."</p>
<p>And then, without intention, with scarcely more consciousness of
movement than belongs to the undermined tree which settles, roots
and all, into the swollen stream, he turned and moved toward the
door.</p>
<p>Clotilde rose.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Grandissime."</p>
<p>He stopped and looked back.</p>
<p>"We will see Palmyre at once, according to your request."</p>
<p>He turned his eyes toward Aurora.</p>
<p>"Yes," said she, and she buried her face in her handkerchief and
sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>She heard his footstep again; it reached the door; the door
opened--closed; she heard his footstep again; was he gone?</p>
<p>He was gone.</p>
<p>The two women threw themselves into each other's arms and wept.
Presently Clotilde left the room. She came back in a moment from
the rear apartment, with a bonnet and veil in her hands.</p>
<p>"No," said Aurora, rising quickly, "I must do it."</p>
<p>"There is no time to lose," said Clotilde. "It will soon be
dark."</p>
<p>It was hardly a minute before Aurora was ready to start. A kiss,
a sorrowful look of love exchanged, the veil dropped over the
swollen eyes, and Aurora was gone.</p>
<p>A minute passed, hardly more, and--what was this?--the soft
patter of Aurora's knuckles on the door.</p>
<p>"Just here at the corner I saw Palmyre leaving her house and
walking down the rue Royale. We must wait until morn--"</p>
<p>Again a footfall on the doorstep, and the door, which was
standing ajar, was pushed slightly by the force of the masculine
knock which followed.</p>
<p>"Allow me," said the voice of Honor&eacute; Grandissime, as
Aurora bowed at the door. "I should have handed you this;
good-day."</p>
<p>She received a missive. It was long, like an official document;
it bore evidence of having been carried for some hours in a
coat-pocket, and was folded in one of those old, troublesome ways
in use before the days of envelopes. Aurora pulled it open.</p>
<p>"It is all figures; light a candle."</p>
<p>The candle was lighted by Clotilde and held over Aurora's
shoulder; they saw a heading and footing more conspicuous than the
rest of the writing.</p>
<p>The heading read:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Aurora and Clotilde Nancanou, owners of Fausse
Rivi&egrave;re<br>
Plantation, in account with Honor&eacute;
Grandissime</i>."</blockquote>
<p>The footing read:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Balance at credit, subject to order of Aurora and
Clotilde<br>
Nancanou, $105,000.00</i>."</blockquote>
<p>The date followed:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>March</i> 9, 1804."</blockquote>
<p>and the signature:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>H. Grandissime</i>."</blockquote>
<p>A small piece of torn white paper slipped from the account to
the floor. Clotilde's eye followed it, but Aurora, without
acknowledgement of having seen it, covered it with her foot.</p>
<p>In the morning Aurora awoke first. She drew from under her
pillow this slip of paper. She had not dared look at it until now.
The writing on it had been roughly scratched down with a pencil. It
read:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Not for love of woman, but in the name of justice
and the<br>
fear of God</i>."</blockquote>
<p>"And I was so cruel," she whispered.</p>
<p>Ah! Honor&eacute; Grandissime, she was kind to that little
writing! She did not put it back under her pillow; she <i>kept it
warm</i>, Honor&eacute; Grandissime, from that time forth.</p>

<h3>BAD FOR CHARLIE KEENE</h3>
<br>
<p>On the same evening of which we have been telling, about the
time that Aurora and Clotilde were dropping their last tear of joy
over the document of restitution, a noticeable figure stood alone
at the corner of the rue du Canal and the rue Chartres. He had
reached there and paused, just as the brighter glare of the set sun
was growing dim above the tops of the cypresses. After walking with
some rapidity of step, he had stopped aimlessly, and laid his hand
with an air of weariness upon a rotting China-tree that leaned over
the ditch at the edge of the unpaved walk.</p>
<p>"Setting in cypress," he murmured. We need not concern ourselves
as to his meaning.</p>
<p>One could think aloud there with impunity. In 1804, Canal street
was the upper boundary of New Orleans. Beyond it, to southward, the
open plain was dotted with country-houses, brick-kilns, clumps of
live-oak and groves of pecan. At the hour mentioned the outlines of
these objects were already darkening. At one or two points the sky
was reflected from marshy ponds. Out to westward rose conspicuously
the old house and willow-copse of Jean Poquelin. Down the empty
street or road, which stretched with arrow-like straightness toward
the northwest, the draining-canal that gave it its name tapered
away between occasional overhanging willows and beside broken ranks
of rotting palisades, its foul, crawling waters blushing, gilding
and purpling under the swiftly waning light, and ending suddenly in
the black shadow of the swamp. The observer of this dismal prospect
leaned heavily on his arm, and cast his glance out along the
beautified corruption of the canal. His eye seemed quickened to
detect the smallest repellant details of the scene; every cypress
stump that stood in, or overhung, the slimy water; every ruined
indigo-vat or blasted tree, every broken thing, every bleached bone
of ox or horse--and they were many--for roods around. As his eye
passed them slowly over and swept back again around the dreary
view, he sighed heavily and said: "Dissolution," and then
again--"Dissolution! order of the day--"</p>
<p>A secret overhearer might have followed, by these occasional
exclamatory utterances, the course of a devouring trouble prowling
up and down through his thoughts, as one's eye tracks the shark by
the occasional cutting of his fin above the water.</p>
<p>He spoke again:</p>
<p>"It is in such moods as this that fools drown themselves."</p>
<p>His speech was French. He straightened up, smote the tree softly
with his palm, and breathed a long, deep sigh--such a sigh, if the
very truth be told, as belongs by right to a lover. And yet his
mind did not dwell on love.</p>
<p>He turned and left the place; but the trouble that was plowing
hither and thither through the deep of his meditations went with
him. As he turned into the rue Chartres it showed itself thus:</p>
<p>"Right; it is but right;" he shook his head slowly--"it is but
right."</p>
<p>In the rue Douane he spoke again:</p>
<p>"Ah! Frowenfeld"--and smiled unpleasantly, with his head
down.</p>
<p>And as he made yet another turn, and took his meditative way
down the city's front, along the blacksmith's shops in the street
afterward called Old Levee, he resumed, in English, and with a
distinctness that made a staggering sailor halt and look after
him:</p>
<p>"There are but two steps to civilization, the first easy, the
second difficult; to construct--to reconstruct--ah! there it is!
the tearing down! The tear'--"</p>
<p>He was still, but repeated the thought by a gesture of distress
turned into a slow stroke of the forehead.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Honor&eacute; Grandissime," said a voice just
ahead.</p>
<p>"<i>Eh, bien</i>?"</p>
<p>At the mouth of an alley, in the dim light of the streep lamp,
stood the dark figure of Honor&eacute; Grandissime, f.m.c., holding
up the loosely hanging form of a small man, the whole front of
whose clothing was saturated with blood.</p>
<p>"Why, Charlie Keene! Let him down again, quickly--quickly; do
not hold him so!"</p>
<p>"Hands off," came in a ghastly whisper from the shape.</p>
<p>"Oh, Chahlie, my boy--"</p>
<p>"Go and finish your courtship," whispered the doctor.</p>
<p>"Oh Charlie, I have just made it forever impossible!"</p>
<p>"Then help me back to my bed; I don't care to die in the
street."</p>

<h3>MORE REPARATION</h3>
<br>
<p>"That is all," said the fairer Honor&eacute;, outside Doctor
Keene's sick-room about ten o'clock at night. He was speaking to
the black son of Clemence, who had been serving as errand-boy for
some hours. He spoke in a low tone just without the half-open door,
folding again a paper which the lad had lately borne to the
apothecary of the rue Royale, and had now brought back with
Joseph's answer written under Honor&eacute;'s inquiry.</p>
<p>"That is all," said the other Honor&eacute;, standing partly
behind the first, as the eyes of his little menial turned upon him
that deprecatory glance of inquiry so common to slave children. The
lad went a little way down the corridor, curled up upon the floor
against the wall, and was soon asleep. The fairer Honor&eacute;
handed the darker the slip of paper; it was received and returned
in silence. The question was:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Can you state anything positive concerning the
duel</i>?"</blockquote>
<p>And the reply:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Positively there will be none. Sylvestre my sworn
friend for<br>
life</i>."</blockquote>
<p>The half-brothers sat down under a dim hanging lamp in the
corridor, and except that every now and then one or the other
stepped noiselessly to the door to look in upon the sleeping sick
man, or in the opposite direction to moderate by a push with the
foot the snoring of Clemence's "boy," they sat the whole night
through in whispered counsel.</p>
<p>The one, at the request of the other, explained how he had come
to be with the little doctor in such extremity.</p>
<p>It seems that Clemence, seeing and understanding the doctor's
imprudence, had sallied out with the resolve to set some person on
his track. We have said that she went in search of her master. Him
she met, and though she could not really count him one of the
doctor's friends, yet, rightly believing in his humanity, she told
him the matter. He set off in what was for him a quick pace in
search of the rash invalid, was misdirected by a too confident
child and had given up the hope of finding him, when a faint sound
of distress just at hand drew him into an alley, where, close down
against a wall, with his face to the earth, lay Doctor Keene. The
f.m.c. had just raised him and borne him out of the alley when
Honor&eacute; came up.</p>
<p>"And you say that, when you would have inquired for him at
Frowenfeld's, you saw Palmyre there, standing and talking with
Frowenfeld? Tell me more exactly."</p>
<p>And the other, with that grave and gentle economy of words which
made his speech so unique, recounted what we amplify:</p>
<p>Palmyre had needed no pleading to induce her to exonerate
Joseph. The doctors were present at Frowenfeld's in more than usual
number. There was unusualness, too, in their manner and their talk.
They were not entirely free from the excitement of the day, and as
they talked--with an air of superiority, of Creole inflammability,
and with some contempt--concerning Camille Brahmin's and Charlie
Mandarin's efforts to precipitate a war, they were yet visibly in a
state of expectation. Frowenfeld, they softly said, had in his odd
way been indiscreet among these inflammables at Maspero's just when
he could least afford to be so, and there was no telling what they
might take the notion to do to him before bedtime. All that over
and above the independent, unexplained scandal of the early
morning. So Joseph and his friends this evening, like Aurora and
Clotilde in the morning, were, as we nowadays say of buyers and
sellers, "apart," when suddenly and unannounced, Palmyre presented
herself among them. When the f.m.c. saw her, she had already handed
Joseph his hat and with much sober grace was apologizing for her
slave's mistake. All evidence of her being wounded was concealed.
The extraordinary excitement of the morning had not hurt her, and
she seemed in perfect health. The doctors sat or stood around and
gave rapt attention to her patois, one or two translating it for
Joseph, and he blushing to the hair, but standing erect and
receiving it at second hand with silent bows. The f.m.c. had gazed
on her for a moment, and then forced himself away. He was among the
few who had not heard the morning scandal, and he did not
comprehend the evening scene. He now asked Honor&eacute; concerning
it, and quietly showed great relief when it was explained.</p>
<p>Then Honor&eacute;, breaking a silence, called the attention of
the f.m.c. to the fact that the latter had two tenants at Number 19
rue Bienville. Honor&eacute; became the narrator now and told all,
finally stating that the die was cast--restitution made.</p>
<p>And then the darker Honor&eacute; made a proposition to the
other, which, it is little to say, was startling. They discussed it
for hours.</p>
<p>"So just a condition," said the merchant, raising his whisper so
much that the rentier laid a hand in his elbow,--"such mere
justice," he said, more softly, "ought to be an easy condition. God
knows"--he lifted his glance reverently--"my very right to exist
comes after yours. You are the elder."</p>
<p>The solemn man offered no disclaimer.</p>
<p>What could the proposition be which involved so grave an issue,
and to which M. Grandissime's final answer was "I will do it"?</p>
<p>It was that Honor&eacute; f.m.c. should become a member of the
mercantile house of H. Grandissime, enlisting in its capital all
his wealth. And the one condition was that the new style should be
<i>Grandissime Brothers</i>.</p>

<h3>THE PIQUE-EN-TERRE LOSES ONE OF HER CREW</h3>
<br>
<p>Ask the average resident of New Orleans if his town is on an
island, and he will tell you no. He will also wonder how any one
could have got that notion,--so completely has Orleans Island,
whose name at the beginning of the present century was in
everybody's mouth, been forgotten. It was once a question of
national policy, a point of difference between Republican and
Federalist, whether the United States ought to buy this little
strip of semi-submerged land, or whether it would not be more
righteous to steal it. The Kentuckians kept the question at a red
heat by threatening to become an empire by themselves if one course
or the other was not taken; but when the First Consul offered to
sell all Louisiana, our commissioners were quite robbed of breath.
They had approached to ask a hair from the elephant's tail, and
were offered the elephant.</p>
<p>For Orleans Island--island it certainly was until General
Jackson closed Bayou Manchac--is a narrow, irregular, flat tract of
forest, swamp, city, prairie and sea-marsh, lying east and west,
with the Mississippi, trending southeastward, for its southern
boundary, and for its northern, a parallel and contiguous chain of
alternate lakes and bayous, opening into the river through Bayou
Manchac, and into the Gulf through the passes of the Malheureuse
Islands. On the narrowest part of it stands New Orleans. Turning
and looking back over the rear of the town, one may easily see from
her steeples Lake Pontchartrain glistening away to the northern
horizon, and in his fancy extend the picture to right and left till
Pontchartrain is linked in the west by Pass Manchac to Lake
Maurepas, and in the east by the Rigolets and Chef Menteur to Lake
Borgne.</p>
<p>An oddity of the Mississippi Delta is the habit the little
streams have of running away from the big ones. The river makes its
own bed and its own banks, and continuing season after season,
through ages of alternate overflow and subsidence, to elevate those
banks, creates a ridge which thus becomes a natural elevated
aqueduct. Other slightly elevated ridges mark the present or former
courses of minor outlets, by which the waters of the Mississippi
have found the sea. Between these ridges lie the cypress swamps,
through whose profound shades the clear, dark, deep bayous creep
noiselessly away into the tall grasses of the shaking prairies. The
original New Orleans was built on the Mississippi ridge, with one
of these forest-and-water-covered basins stretching back behind her
to westward and northward, closed in by Metairie Ridge and Lake
Pontchartrain. Local engineers preserve the tradition that the
Bayou Sauvage once had its rise, so to speak, in Toulouse street.
Though depleted by the city's present drainage system and most
likely poisoned by it as well, its waters still move seaward in a
course almost due easterly, and empty into Chef Menteur, one of the
watery threads of a tangled skein of "passes" between the lakes and
the open Gulf. Three-quarters of a century ago this Bayou Sauvage
(or Gentilly--corruption of Chantilly) was a navigable stream of
wild and sombre beauty.</p>
<p>On a certain morning in August, 1804, and consequently some five
months after the events last mentioned, there emerged from the
darkness of Bayou Sauvage into the prairie-bordered waters of Chef
Menteur, while the morning star was still luminous in the sky above
and in the water below, and only the practised eye could detect the
first glimmer of day, a small, stanch, single-masted, broad and
very light-draught boat, whose innocent character, primarily
indicated in its coat of many colors,--the hull being yellow below
the water line and white above, with tasteful stripings of blue and
red,--was further accentuated by the peaceful name of
<i>Pique-en-terre</i> (the Sandpiper).</p>
<p>She seemed, too, as she entered the Chef Menteur, as if she
would have liked to turn southward; but the wind did not permit
this, and in a moment more the water was rippling after her swift
rudder, as she glided away in the direction of Pointe Aux Herbes.
But when she had left behind her the mouth of the passage, she
changed her course and, leaving the Pointe on her left, bore down
toward Petites Coquilles, obviously bent upon passing through the
Rigolets.</p>
<p>We know not how to describe the joyousness of the effect when at
length one leaves behind him the shadow and gloom of the swamp, and
there bursts upon his sight the widespread, flower-decked,
bird-haunted prairies of Lake Catharine. The inside and outside of
a prison scarcely furnish a greater contrast; and on this fair
August morning the contrast was at its strongest. The day broke
across a glad expanse of cool and fragrant green, silver-laced with
a network of crisp salt pools and passes, lakes, bayous and
lagoons, that gave a good smell, the inspiring odor of interclasped
sea and shore, and both beautified and perfumed the happy earth,
laid bare to the rising sun. Waving marshes of wild oats, drooping
like sated youth from too much pleasure; watery acres hid under
crisp-growing greenth starred with pond-lilies and rippled by
water-fowl; broad stretches of high grass, with thousands of
ecstatic wings palpitating above them; hundreds of thousands of
white and pink mallows clapping their hands in voiceless rapture,
and that amazon queen of the wild flowers, the morning-glory,
stretching her myriad lines, lifting up the trumpet and waving her
colors, white, azure and pink, with lacings of spider's web, heavy
with pearls and diamonds--the gifts of the summer night. The crew
of the <i>Pique-en-terre</i> saw all these and felt them; for,
whatever they may have been or failed to be, they were men whose
heartstrings responded to the touches of nature. One alone of their
company, and he the one who should have felt them most, showed
insensibility, sighed laughingly and then laughed sighingly, in the
face of his fellows and of all this beauty, and profanely confessed
that his heart's desire was to get back to his wife. He had been
absent from her now for nine hours!</p>
<p>But the sun is getting high; Petites Coquilles has been passed
and left astern, the eastern end of Las Conchas is on the
after-larboard-quarter, the briny waters of Lake Borgne flash far
and wide their dazzling white and blue, and, as the little boat
issues from the deep channel of the Rigolets, the white-armed waves
catch her and toss her like a merry babe. A triumph for the
helmsman--he it is who sighs, at intervals of tiresome frequency,
for his wife. He had, from the very starting-place in the upper
waters of Bayou Sauvage, declared in favor of the Rigolets as--wind
and tide considered--the most practicable of all the passes. Now
that they were out, he forgot for a moment the self-amusing plaint
of conjugal separation to flaunt his triumph. Would any one
hereafter dispute with him on the subject of Louisiana sea-coast
navigation? He knew every pass and piece of water like A, B, C, and
could tell, faster, much faster than he could repeat the
multiplication table (upon which he was a little slow and
doubtful), the amount of water in each at ebb tide--Pass Jean or
Petit Pass, Unknown Pass, Petit Rigolet, Chef Menteur,--</p>
<p>Out on the far southern horizon, in the Gulf--the Gulf of
Mexico--there appears a speck of white. It is known to those on
board the <i>Pique-en-terre</i>, the moment it is descried, as the
canvas of a large schooner. The opinion, first expressed by the
youthful husband, who still reclines with the tiller held firmly
under his arm, and then by another member of the company who sits
on the centreboard-well, is unanimously adopted, that she is making
for the Rigolets, will pass Petites Coquilles by eleven o'clock,
and will tie up at the little port of St. Jean, on the bayou of the
same name, before sundown, if the wind holds anywise as it is.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the master of the distant schooner shuts his
glass, and says to the single passenger whom he has aboard that the
little sail just visible toward the Rigolets is a sloop with a
half-deck, well filled with men, in all probability a pleasure
party bound to the Chandeleurs on a fishing and gunning excursion,
and passes into comments on the superior skill of landsmen over
seamen in the handling of small sailing craft.</p>
<p>By and by the two vessels near each other. They approach within
hailing distance, and are announcing each to each their identity,
when the young man at the tiller jerks himself to a squatting
posture, and, from under a broad-brimmed and slouched straw hat,
cries to the schooner's one passenger:</p>
<p>"Hello, Challie Keene."</p>
<p>And the passenger more quietly answers back:</p>
<p>"Hello, Raoul, is that you?"</p>
<p>M. Innerarity replied, with a profane parenthesis, that it was
he.</p>
<p>"You kin hask Sylvestre!" he concluded.</p>
<p>The doctor's eye passed around a semicircle of some eight men,
the most of whom were quite young, but one or two of whom were
gray, sitting with their arms thrown out upon the wash-board, in
the dark n&eacute;glig&eacute; of amateur fishermen and with that
exultant look of expectant deviltry in their handsome faces which
characterizes the Creole with his collar off.</p>
<p>The mettlesome little doctor felt the odds against him in the
exchange of greetings.</p>
<p>"Ola, Dawctah!"</p>
<p>"<i>H&eacute;</i>, Doctah, <i>que-ce qui t'apr&egrave;s
f&eacute;?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Ho, ho, comp&egrave;re Noyo!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Comment va</i>, Docta?"</p>
<p>A light peppering of profanity accompanied each salute.</p>
<p>The doctor put on defensively a smile of superiority to the
juniors and of courtesy to the others, and responsively spoke their
names:</p>
<p>"'Polyte--Sylvestre--Achille--&Eacute;mile--ah! Agamemnon."</p>
<p>The Doctor and Agamemnon raised their hats.</p>
<p>As Agamemnon was about to speak, a general expostulatory outcry
drowned his voice. The <i>Pique-en-terre</i> was going about close
abreast of the schooner, and angry questions and orders were flying
at Raoul's head like a volley of eggs.</p>
<p>"Messieurs," said Raoul, partially rising but still stooping
over the tiller, and taking his hat off his bright curls with mock
courtesy, "I am going back to New Orleans. I would not give
<i>that</i> for all the fish in the sea; I want to see my wife. I
am going back to New Orleans to see my wife--and to congratulate
the city upon your absence." Incredulity, expostulation, reproach,
taunt, malediction--he smiled unmoved upon them all.</p>
<p>"Messieurs, I <i>must</i> go and see my wife."</p>
<p>Amid redoubled outcries he gave the helm to Camille Brahmin, and
fighting his way with his pretty feet against half-real efforts to
throw him overboard, clambered forward to the mast, whence a moment
later, with the help of the schooner-master's hand, he reached the
deck of the larger vessel. The <i>Pique-en-terre</i> turned, and
with a little flutter spread her smooth wing and skimmed away.</p>
<p>"Doctah Keene, look yeh!" M. Innerarity held up a hand whose
third finger wore the conventional ring of the Creole bridegroom.
"W'at you got to say to dat?"</p>
<p>The little doctor felt a faintness run through his veins, and a
thrill of anger follow it. The poor man could not imagine a love
affair that did not include Clotilde Nancanou.</p>
<p>"Whom have you married?"</p>
<p>"De pritties' gal in de citty."</p>
<p>The questioner controlled himself.</p>
<p>"M-hum," he responded, with a contraction of the eyes.</p>
<p>Raoul waited an instant for some kindlier comment, and finding
the hope vain, suddenly assumed a look of delighted admiration.</p>
<p>"Hi, yi, yi! Doctah, 'ow you har lookingue fine."</p>
<p>The true look of the doctor was that he had not much longer to
live. A smile of bitter humor passed over his face, and he looked
for a near seat, saying:</p>
<p>"How's Frowenfeld?"</p>
<p>Raoul struck an ecstatic attitude and stretched forth his hand
as if the doctor could not fail to grasp it. The invalid's heart
sank like lead.</p>
<p>"Frowenfeld has got her," he thought.</p>
<p>"Well?" said he with a frown of impatience and restraint; and
Raoul cried:</p>
<p>"I sole my pigshoe!"</p>
<p>The doctor could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Shades of the masters!"</p>
<p>"No; 'Louizyanna rif-using to hantre de h-Union.'"</p>
<p>The doctor stood corrected.</p>
<p>The two walked across the deck, following the shadow of the
swinging sail. The doctor lay down in a low-swung hammock, and
Raoul sat upon the deck <i>&agrave; la Turque</i>.</p>
<p>"Come, come, Raoul, tell me, what is the news?"</p>
<p>"News? Oh, I donno. You 'eard concernin' the dool?"</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say--"</p>
<p>"Yesseh!"</p>
<p>"Agricola and Sylvestre?"</p>
<p>"W'at de dev'! No! Burr an' 'Ammiltong; in Noo-Juzzy-las-June.
Collonnel Burr, 'e--"</p>
<p>"Oh, fudge! yes. How is Frowenfeld?"</p>
<p>"'E's well. Guess 'ow much I sole my pigshoe."</p>
<p>"Well, how much?"</p>
<p>"Two 'ondred fifty." He laid himself out at length, his elbow on
the deck, his head in his hand. "I believe I'm sorry I sole
'er."</p>
<p>"I don't wonder. How's Honor&eacute;? Tell me what has happened.
Remember, I've been away five months."</p>
<p>"No; I am verrie glad dat I sole 'er. What? Ha! I should think
so! If it have not had been fo' dat I would not be married to-day.
You think I would get married on dat sal'rie w'at Proffis-or
Frowenfel' was payin' me? Twenty-five dolla' de mont'? Docta Keene,
no gen'leman h-ought to git married if 'e 'ave not anny'ow fifty
dolla' de mont'! If I wasn' a h-artiz I wouldn' git married; I gie
you my word!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the little doctor, "you are right. Now tell me the
news."</p>
<p>"Well, dat Cong-ress gone an' make--"</p>
<p>"Raoul, stop. I know that Congress has divided the province into
two territories; I know you Creoles think all your liberties are
lost; I know the people are in a great stew because they are not
allowed to elect their own officers and legislatures, and that in
Opelousas and Attakapas they are as wild as their cattle about
it--"</p>
<p>"We 'ad two big mitting' about it," interrupted Raoul; "my
bro'r-in-law speak at both of them!"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Chahlie Mandarin."</p>
<p>"Glad to hear it," said Doctor Keene,--which was the truth.
"Besides that, I know Laussat has gone to Martinique; that the
Am&eacute;ricains have a newspaper, and that cotton is two-bits a
pound. Now what I want to know is, how are my friends? What has
Honor&eacute; done? What has Frowenfeld done? And Palmyre,--and
Agricole? They hustled me away from here as if I had been caught
trying to cut my throat. Tell me everything."</p>
<p>And Raoul sank the artist and bridegroom in the historian, and
told him.</p>

<p>"Psh-sh-sh! Board! Dey woon board de Marquis of Casa Calvo! I

'e don' care.</p>
<p>"But I di'n' t'ink Honor&eacute; could ever do lak dat odder

<p>"What way?"</p>
<p>"W'at? You dunno? You don' yeh 'ow 'e gone partner' wid a

<p>"Yesseh! 'e gone partner' wid dat quadroon w'at call 'imself

<p>That evening, at candle-light, Raoul got the right arm of his
slender, laughing wife about his neck; but Doctor Keene tarried all
night in suburb St. Jean. He hardly felt the moral courage to face
the results of the last five months. Let us understand them better
ourselves.</p>

<h3>AN INDIGNANT FAMILY AND A SMASHED SHOP</h3>
<br>
<p>It was indeed a fierce storm that had passed over the head of
Honor&eacute; Grandissime. Taken up and carried by it, as it seemed
to him, without volition, he had felt himself thrown here and
there, wrenched, torn, gasping for moral breath, speaking the right
word as if in delirium, doing the right deed as if by helpless
instinct, and seeing himself in every case, at every turn, tricked
by circumstance out of every vestige of merit. So it seemed to him.
The long contemplated restitution was accomplished. On the morning
when Aurora and Clotilde had expected to be turned shelterless into
the open air, they had called upon him in his private office and
presented the account of which he had put them in possession the
evening before. He had honored it on the spot. To the two ladies
who felt their own hearts stirred almost to tears of gratitude, he
was--as he sat before them calm, unmoved, handling keen-edged facts
with the easy rapidity of one accustomed to use them, smiling
courteously and collectedly, parrying their expressions of
appreciation--to them, we say, at least to one of them, he was "the
prince of gentlemen." But, at the same time, there was within him,
unseen, a surge of emotions, leaping, lashing, whirling, yet ever
hurrying onward along the hidden, rugged bed of his honest
intention.</p>
<p>The other restitution, which even twenty-four hours earlier
might have seemed a pure self-sacrifice, became a self-rescue. The
f.m.c. was the elder brother. A remark of Honor&eacute; made the
night they watched in the corridor by Doctor Keene's door, about
the younger's "right to exist," was but the echo of a conversation
they had once had together in Europe. There they had practised a
familiarity of intercourse which Louisiana would not have endured,
and once, when speaking upon the subject of their common
fatherhood, the f.m.c., prone to melancholy speech, had said:</p>
<p>"You are the lawful son of Numa Grandissime; I had no right to
be born."</p>
<p>But Honor&eacute; quickly answered:</p>
<p>"By the laws of men, it may be; but by the law of God's justice,
you are the lawful son, and it is I who should not have been
born."</p>
<p>But, returned to Louisiana, accepting with the amiable,
old-fashioned philosophy of conservatism the sins of the community,
he had forgotten the unchampioned rights of his passive
half-brother. Contact with Frowenfeld had robbed him of his
pleasant mental drowsiness, and the oft-encountered apparition of
the dark sharer of his name had become a slow-stepping, silent
embodiment of reproach. The turn of events had brought him face to
face with the problem of restitution, and he had solved it. But
where had he come out? He had come out the beneficiary of this
restitution, extricated from bankruptcy by an agreement which gave
the f.m.c. only a public recognition of kinship which had always
been his due. Bitter cup of humiliation!</p>
<p>Such was the stress within. Then there was the storm without.
The Grandissimes were in a high state of excitement. The news had
reached them all that Honor&eacute; had met the question of titles
by selling one of their largest estates. It was received with
wincing frowns, indrawn breath, and lifted feet, but without
protest, and presently with a smile of returning confidence.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute; knew; Honor&eacute; was informed; they had all
authorized Honor&eacute;; and Honor&eacute;, though he might have
his odd ways and notions, picked up during that unfortunate stay
abroad, might safely be trusted to stand by the interests of his
people."</p>
<p>After the first shock some of them even raised a laugh:</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Honor&eacute; would show those Yankees!"</p>
<p>They went to his counting-room and elsewhere, in search of him,
to smite their hands into the hands of their far-seeing young
champion. But, as we have seen, they did not find him; none dreamed
of looking for him in an enemy's camp (19 Bienville) or on the
lonely suburban commons, talking to himself in the ghostly
twilight; and the next morning, while Aurora and Clotilde were
seated before him in his private office, looking first at the face
and then at the back of two mighty drafts of equal amount on
Philadelphia, the cry of treason flew forth to these astounded
Grandissimes, followed by the word that the sacred fire was gone
out in the Grandissime temple (counting-room), that Delilahs in
duplicate were carrying off the holy treasures, and that the
uncircumcised and unclean--even an f.m.c.--was about to be inducted
into the Grandissime priesthood.</p>
<p>Aurora and Clotilde were still there, when the various members
of the family began to arrive and display their outlines in
impatient shadow-play upon the glass door of the private office;
now one, and now another, dallied with the doorknob and by and by
obtruded their lifted hats and urgent, anxious faces half into the
apartment; but Honor&eacute; would only glance toward them, and
with a smile equally courteous, authoritative and fleeting,
say:</p>
<p>"Good-morning, Camille" (or Charlie--or Agamemnon, as the case
might be); "I will see you later; let me trouble you to close the
door."</p>
<p>To add yet another strain, the two ladies, like frightened,
rescued children, would cling to their deliverer. They wished him
to become the custodian and investor of their wealth. Ah, woman!
who is a tempter like thee? But Honor&eacute; said no, and showed
them the danger of such a course.</p>
<p>"Suppose I should die suddenly. You might have trouble with my
executors."</p>
<p>The two beauties assented pensively; but in Aurora's bosom a
great throb secretly responded that as for her, in that case, she
should have no use for money--in a nunnery.</p>
<p>"Would not Monsieur at least consent to be their financial
adviser?"</p>
<p>He hemmed, commenced a sentence twice, and finally said:</p>
<p>"You will need an agent; some one to take full charge of your
affairs; some person on whose sagacity and integrity you can place
the fullest dependence."</p>
<p>"Who, for instance?" asked Aurora.</p>
<p>"I should say, without hesitation, Professor Frowenfeld, the
apothecary. You know his trouble of yesterday is quite cleared up.
You had not heard? Yes. He is not what we call an enterprising man,
but--so much the better. Take him all in all, I would choose him
above all others; if you--"</p>
<p>Aurora interrupted him. There was an ill-concealed wildness in
her eye and a slight tremor in her voice, as she spoke, which she
had not expected to betray. The quick, though quiet eye of
Honor&eacute; Grandissime saw it, and it thrilled him through.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Grandissime, I take the risk; I wish you to take care of
my money."</p>
<p>"But, Maman," said Clotilde, turning with a timid look to her
mother, "If Monsieur Grandissime would rather not--"</p>
<p>Aurora, feeling alarmed at what she had said, rose up. Clotilde
and Honor&eacute; did the same, and he said:</p>
<p>"With Professor Frowenfeld in charge of your affairs, I shall
feel them not entirely removed from my care also. We are very good
friends."</p>
<p>Clotilde looked at her mother. The three exchanged glances. The
ladies signified their assent and turned to go, but M. Grandissime
stopped them.</p>
<p>"By your leave, I will send for him. If you will be seated
again--"</p>
<p>They thanked him and resumed their seats; he excused himself,
passed into the counting-room, and sent a messenger for the
apothecary.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime's meeting with his kinsmen was a stormy one.
Aurora and Clotilde heard the strife begin, increase, subside, rise
again and decrease. They heard men stride heavily to and fro, they
heard hands smite together, palms fall upon tables and fists upon
desks, heard half-understood statement and unintelligible
counter-statement and derisive laughter; and, in the midst of all,
like the voice of a man who rules himself, the clear-noted,
unimpassioned speech of Honor&eacute;, sounding so loftily
beautiful in the ear of Aurora that when Clotilde looked at her,
sitting motionless with her rapt eyes lifted up, those eyes came
down to her own with a sparkle of enthusiasm, and she softly
said:</p>
<p>"It sounds like St. Gabriel!" and then blushed.</p>
<p>Clotilde answered with a happy, meaning look, which intensified
the blush, and then leaning affectionately forward and holding the
maman's eyes with her own, she said:</p>
<p>"You have my consent."</p>
<p>"Saucy!" said Aurora. "Wait till I get my own."</p>
<p>Some of his kinsmen Honor&eacute; pacified; some he silenced. He
invited all to withdraw their lands and moneys from his charge, and
some accepted the invitation. They spurned his parting advice to
sell, and the policy they then adopted, and never afterward
modified, was that "all or nothing" attitude which, as years rolled
by, bled them to penury in those famous
cupping-leeching-and-bleeding establishments, the courts of
Louisiana. You may see their grandchildren, to-day, anywhere within
the angle of the old rues Esplanade and Rampart, holding up their
heads in unspeakable poverty, their nobility kept green by
unflinching self-respect, and their poetic and pathetic pride
revelling in ancestral, perennial rebellion against common
sense.</p>
<p>"That is Agricola," whispered Aurora, with lifted head and eyes
dilated and askance, as one deep-chested voice roared above all
others.</p>
<p>Agricola stormed.</p>
<p>"Uncle," Aurora by and by heard Honor&eacute; say, "shall I
leave my own counting-room?"</p>
<p>At that moment Joseph Frowenfeld entered, pausing with one hand
on the outer rail. No one noticed him but Honor&eacute;, who was
watching for him, and who, by a silent motion, directed him into
the private office.</p>
<p>"H-whe shake its dust from our feet!" said Agricola, gathering
some young retainers by a sweep of his glance and going out down
the stair in the arched way, unmoved by the fragrance of warm
bread. On the banquette he harangued his followers.</p>
<p>He said that in such times as these every lover of liberty
should go armed; that the age of trickery had come; that by
trickery Louisianians had been sold, like cattle, to a nation of
parvenues, to be dragged before juries for asserting the human
right of free trade or ridding the earth of sneaks in the pay of
the government; that laws, so-called, had been forged into
thumbscrews, and a Congress which had bound itself to give them all
the rights of American citizens--sorry boon!--was preparing to slip
their birthright acres from under their feet, and leave them
hanging, a bait to the vultures of the Am&eacute;ricain
immigration. Yes; the age of trickery! Its apostles, he said, were
even then at work among their fellow-citizens, warping, distorting,
blasting, corrupting, poisoning the noble, unsuspecting, confiding
Creole mind. For months the devilish work had been allowed, by a
patient, peace-loving people, to go on. But shall it go on forever?
(Cries of "No!" "No!") The smell of white blood comes on the south
breeze. Dessalines and Christophe had recommenced their hellish
work. Virginia, too, trembles for the safety of her fair mothers
and daughters. We know not what is being plotted in the canebrakes
of Louisiana. But we know that in the face of these things the
prelates of trickery are sitting in Washington allowing throats to
go unthrottled that talked tenderly about the "negro slave;" we
know worse: we know that mixed blood has asked for equal rights
from a son of the Louisiana noblesse, and that those sacred rights
have been treacherously, pusillanimously surrendered into its
possession. Why did we not rise yesterday, when the public heart
was stirred? The forbearance of this people would be absurd if it
were not saintly. But the time has, come when Louisiana must
protect herself! If there is one here who will not strike for his
lands, his rights and the purity of his race, let him speak! (Cries
of "We will rise now!" "Give us a leader!" "Lead the way!")</p>
<p>"Kinsmen, friends," continued Agricola, "meet me at nightfall
before the house of this too-long-spared mulatto. Come armed. Bring
a few feet of stout rope. By morning the gentlemen of color will
know their places better than they do to-day; h-whe shall
understand each other! H-whe shall set the negrophiles to
meditating."</p>
<p>He waved them away.</p>
<p>With a huzza the accumulated crowd moved off. Chance carried
them up the rue Royale; they sang a song; they came to
Frowenfeld's. It was an Am&eacute;ricain establishment; that was
against it. It was a gossiping place of Am&eacute;ricain evening
loungers; that was against it. It was a sorcerer's den--(we are on
an ascending scale); its proprietor had refused employment to some
there present, had refused credit to others, was an impudent
condemner of the most approved Creole sins, had been beaten over
the head only the day before; all these were against it. But, worse
still, the building was owned by the f.m.c., and unluckiest of all,
Raoul stood in the door and some of his kinsmen in the crowd
stopped to have a word with him. The crowd stopped. A nameless
fellow in the throng--he was still singing--said: "Here's the
place," and dropped two bricks through the glass of the
show-window. Raoul, with a cry of retaliative rage, drew and lifted
a pistol; but a kinsman jerked it from him and three others quickly
pinioned him and bore him off struggling, pleased to get him away
unhurt. In ten minutes, Frowenfeld's was a broken-windowed,
open-doored house, full of unrecognizable rubbish that had escaped
the torch only through a chance rumor that the Governor's police
were coming, and the consequent stampede of the mob.</p>
<p>Joseph was sitting in M. Grandissime's private office, in
council with him and the ladies, and Aurora was just saying:</p>
<p>"Well, anny'ow, 'Sieur Frowenfel', ad laz you consen'!" and
gathering her veil from her lap, when Raoul burst in, all sweat and
rage.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', we ruin'! Ow pharmacie knock all in pieces!
My pigshoe is los'!"</p>
<p>He dropped into a chair and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Shall we never learn to withhold our tears until we are sure of
our trouble? Raoul little knew the joy in store for him. 'Polyte,
it transpired the next day, had rushed in after the first volley of
missiles, and while others were gleefully making off with jars of
asafoetida and decanters of distilled water, lifted in his arms and
bore away unharmed "Louisiana" firmly refusing to the last to enter
the Union. It may not be premature to add that about four weeks
later Honor&eacute; Grandissime, upon Raoul's announcement that he
was "betrothed," purchased this painting and presented it to a club
of <i>natural connoisseurs</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX"></a>CHAPTER XLIX</h2>
<h3>OVER THE NEW STORE</h3>
<br>
<p>The accident of the ladies Nancanou making their new home over
Frowenfeld's drug-store occurred in the following rather amusing
way. It chanced that the building was about completed at the time
that the apothecary's stock in trade was destroyed; Frowenfeld
leased the lower floor. Honor&eacute; Grandissime f.m.c. was the
owner. He being concealed from his enemies, Joseph treated with
that person's inadequately remunerated employ&eacute;. In those
days, as still in the old French Quarter, it was not uncommon for
persons, even of wealth, to make their homes over stores, and
buildings were constructed with a view to their partition in this
way. Hence, in Chartres and Decatur streets, to-day--and in the
cross-streets between--so many store-buildings with balconies,
dormer windows, and sometimes even belvideres. This new building
caught the eye and fancy of Aurora and Clotilde. The apartments for
the store were entirely isolated. Through a large
<i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i>, opening upon the banquette immediately
beside and abreast of the store-front, one entered a high, covered
carriage-way with a tessellated pavement and green plastered walls,
and reached,--just where this way (corridor, the Creoles always
called it) opened into a sunny court surrounded with narrow
parterres,--a broad stairway leading to a hall over the "corridor"
and to the drawing-rooms over the store. They liked it! Aurora
would find out at once what sort of an establishment was likely to
be opened below, and if that proved unexceptionable she would lease
the upper part without more ado.</p>
<p>Next day she said:</p>
<p>"Clotilde, thou beautiful, I have signed the lease!"</p>
<p>"Then the store below is to be occupied by a--what?"</p>
<p>"Guess!"</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"Guess a pharmacien!"</p>
<p>Clotilde's lips parted, she was going to smile, when her thought
changed and she blushed offendedly.</p>
<p>"Not--"</p>
<p>"'Sieur Frowenf--ah, ha, ha, ha!--<i>ha, ha, ha</i>!"</p>
<p>Clotilde burst into tears.</p>
<p>Still they moved in--it was written in the bond; and so did the
apothecary; and probably two sensible young lovers never before nor
since behaved with such abject fear of each other--for a time.
Later, and after much oft-repeated good advice given to each
separately and to both together, Honor&eacute; Grandissime
persuaded them that Clotilde could make excellent use of a portion
of her means by reenforcing Frowenfeld's very slender stock and
well filling his rather empty-looking store, and so they signed
regular articles of copartnership, blushing frightfully.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld became a visitor, Honor&eacute; not; once
Honor&eacute; had seen the ladies' moneys satisfactorily invested,
he kept aloof. It is pleasant here to remark that neither Aurora
nor Clotilde made any waste of their sudden acquisitions; they
furnished their rooms with much beauty at moderate cost, and their
<i>salon</i> with artistic, not extravagant, elegance, and, for the
sake of greater propriety, employed a decayed lady as housekeeper;
but, being discreet in all other directions, they agreed upon one
bold outlay--a volante.</p>
<p>Almost any afternoon you might have seen this vehicle on the
Terre aux Boeuf, or Bayou, or Tchoupitoulas Road; and because of
the brilliant beauty of its occupants it became known from all
other volantes as the "meteor."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld's visits were not infrequent; he insisted on
Clotdlde's knowing just what was being done with her money. Without
indulging ourselves in the pleasure of contemplating his continued
mental unfolding, we may say that his growth became more rapid in
this season of universal expansion; love had entered into his still
compacted soul like a cupid into a rose, and was crowding it wide
open. However, as yet, it had not made him brave. Aurora used to
slip out of the drawing-room, and in some secluded nook of the hall
throw up her clasped hands and go through all the motions of
screaming merriment.</p>
<p>"The little fool!"--it was of her own daughter she whispered
this complimentary remark--"the little fool is afraid of the
fish!"</p>
<p>"You!" she said to Clotilde, one evening after Joseph had gone,
"you call yourself a Creole girl!"</p>
<p>But she expected too much. Nothing so terrorizes a blushing girl
as a blushing man. And then--though they did sometimes
digress--Clotilde and her partner met to talk "business" in a
purely literal sense.</p>
<p>Aurora, after a time, had taken her money into her own
keeping.</p>
<p>"You mighd gid robb' ag'in, you know, 'Sieur Frowenfel'," she
said.</p>
<p>But when he mentioned Clotilde's fortune as subject to the same
contingency, Aurora replied:</p>
<p>"Ah! bud Clotilde mighd gid robb'!"</p>
<p>But for all the exuberance of Aurora's spirits, there was a
cloud in her sky. Indeed, we know it is only when clouds are in the
sky that we get the rosiest tints; and so it was with Aurora. One
night, when she had heard the wicket in the
<i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i> shut behind three evening callers, one
of whom she had rejected a week before, another of whom she
expected to dispose of similarly, and the last of whom was Joseph
Frowenfeld, she began such a merry raillery at Clotilde and such a
hilarious ridicule of the "Professor" that Clotilde would have wept
again had not Aurora, all at once, in the midst of a laugh, dropped
her face in her hands and run from the room in tears. It is one of
the penalties we pay for being joyous, that nobody thinks us
capable of care or the victim of trouble until, in some moment of
extraordinary expansion, our bubble of gayety bursts. Aurora had
been crying of nights. Even that same night, Clotilde awoke, opened
her eyes and beheld her mother risen from the pillow and sitting
upright in the bed beside her; the moon, shining brightly through
the mosquito-bar revealed with distinctness her head slightly
drooped, her face again in her hands and the dark folds of her hair
falling about her shoulders, half-concealing the richly embroidered
bosom of her snowy gown, and coiling in continuous abundance about
her waist and on the slight summer covering of the bed. Before her
on the sheet lay a white paper. Clotilde did not try to decipher
the writing on it; she knew, at sight, the slip that had fallen
from the statement of account on the evening of the ninth of March.
Aurora withdrew her hands from her face--Clotilde shut her eyes;
she heard Aurora put the paper in her bosom.</p>
<p>"Clotilde," she said, very softly.</p>
<p>"Maman," the daughter replied, opening her eyes, reached up her
arms and drew the dear head down.</p>
<p>"Clotilde, once upon a time I woke this way, and, while you were
asleep, left the bed and made a vow to Monsieur Danny. Oh! it was a
sin! but I cannot do those things now; I have been frightened ever
since. I shall never do so any more. I shall never commit another
sin as long as I live!"</p>
<p>Their lips met fervently.</p>
<p>"My sweet sweet," whispered Clotilde, "you looked so beautiful
sitting up with the moonlight all around you!"</p>
<p>"Clotilde, my beautiful daughter," said Aurora, pushing her
bedmate from her and pretending to repress a smile, "I tell you
now, because you don't know, and it is my duty as your mother to
tell you--the meanest wickedness a woman can do in all this bad,
bad world is to look ugly in bed!"</p>
<p>Clotilde answered nothing, and Aurora dropped her outstretched
arms, turned away with an involuntary, tremulous sigh, and after
two or three hours of patient wakefulness, fell asleep.</p>
<p>But at daybreak next morning, he that wrote the paper had not
closed his eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_L"></a>CHAPTER L</h2>
<h3>A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE</h3>
<br>
<p>There was always some flutter among Frowenfeld's employ&eacute;s
when he was asked for, and this time it was the more pronounced
because he was sought by a housemaid from the upper floor. It was
hard for these two or three young Ariels to keep their Creole feet
to the ground when it was presently revealed to their sharp ears
that the "prof-fis-or" was requested to come upstairs.</p>
<p>The new store was an extremely neat, bright, and well-ordered
establishment; yet to ascend into the drawing-rooms seemed to the
apothecary like going from the hold of one of those smart old
packet-ships of his day into the cabin. Aurora came forward, with
the slippers of a Cinderella twinkling at the edge of her robe. It
seemed unfit that the floor under them should not be clouds.</p>
<p>"Proffis-or Frowenfel', good-day! Teg a cha'." She laughed. It
was the pure joy of existence. "You's well? You lookin' verrie
well! Halways bizzie? You fine dad agriz wid you' healt', 'Sieur
Frowenfel'? Yes? Ha, ha, ha!" She suddenly leaned toward him across
the arm of her chair, with an earnest face. "'Sieur Frowenfel',
Palmyre wand see you. You don' wan' come ad 'er 'ouse, eh?--an' you
don' wan' her to come ad yo' bureau. You know, 'Sieur Frowenfel',
she drez the hair of Clotilde an' mieself. So w'en she tell me dad,
I juz say, 'Palmyre, I will sen' for Proffis-or Frowenfel' to come
yeh; but I don' thing 'e comin'.' You know, I din' wan' you to 'ave
dad troub'; but Clotilde--ha, ha, ha! Clotilde is sudge a
foolish--she nevva thing of dad troub' to you--she say she thing
you was too kine-'arted to call dad troub'--ha, ha, ha! So anny'ow
we sen' for you, eh!"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld said he was glad they had done so, whereupon Aurora
rose lightly, saying:</p>
<p>"I go an' sen' her." She started away, but turned back to add:
"You know, 'Sieur Frowenfel', she say she cann' truz nobody bud
y'u." She ended with a low, melodious laugh, bending her joyous
eyes upon the apothecary with her head dropped to one side in a way
to move a heart of flint.</p>
<p>She turned and passed through a door, and by the same way
Palmyre entered. The philosophe came forward noiselessly and with a
subdued expression, different from any Frowenfeld had ever before
seen. At the first sight of her a thrill of disrelish ran through
him of which he was instantly ashamed; as she came nearer he met
her with a deferential bow and the silent tender of a chair. She
sat down, and, after a moment's pause, handed him a sealed
letter.</p>
<p>He turned it over twice, recognized the handwriting, felt the
disrelish return, and said:</p>
<p>"This is addressed to yourself."</p>
<p>She bowed.</p>
<p>"Do you know who wrote it?" he asked.</p>
<p>She bowed again.</p>
<p>"<i>Oui, Mich&eacute;</i>."</p>
<p>"You wish me to open it? I cannot read French."</p>
<p>She seemed to have some explanation to offer, but could not
command the necessary English; however, with the aid of
Frowenfeld's limited guessing powers, she made him understand that
the bearer of the letter to her had brought word from the writer
that it was written in English purposely that M. Frowenfeld--the
only person he was willing should see it--might read it. Frowenfeld
broke the seal and ran his eye over the writing, but remained
silent.</p>
<p>The woman stirred, as if to say "Well?" But he hesitated.</p>
<p>"Palmyre," he suddenly said, with a slight, dissuasive smile,
"it would be a profanation for me to read this."</p>
<p>She bowed to signify that she caught his meaning, then raised
her elbows with an expression of dubiety, and said:</p>
<p>"'E hask you--"</p>
<p>"Yes," murmured the apothecary. He shook his head as if to
protest to himself, and read in a low but audible voice:</p>
<blockquote>"Star of my soul, I approach to die. It is not for me
possible to live without Palmyre. Long time have I so done, but
now, cut off from to see thee, by imprisonment, as it may be
called, love is starving to death. Oh, have pity on the faithful
heart which, since ten years, change not, but forget heaven and
earth for you. Now in the peril of the life, hidden away, that
absence from the sight of you make his seclusion the more worse
than death. Halas! I pine! Not other ten years of despair can I
commence. Accept this love. If so I will live for you, but if to
the contraire, I must die for you. Is there anything at all what I
will not give or even do if Palmyre will be my wife? Ah, no, far
otherwise, there is nothing!" ...</blockquote>
<p>Frowenfeld looked over the top of the letter. Palmyre sat with
her eyes cast down, slowly shaking her head. He returned his glance
to the page, coloring somewhat with annoyance at being made a
proposing medium.</p>
<p>"The English is very faulty here," he said, without looking up.
"He mentions Bras-Coup&eacute;." Palmyre started and turned toward
him; but he went on without lifting his eyes. "He speaks of your
old pride and affection toward him as one who with your aid might
have been a leader and deliverer of his people." Frowenfeld looked
up. "Do you under--"</p>
<p>"<i>Allez, Mich&eacute;</i>" said she, leaning forward, her
great eyes fixed on the apothecary and her face full of distress.
"<i>Mo comprend bien</i>."</p>
<p>"He asks you to let him be to you in the place of
Bras-Coup&eacute;."</p>
<p>The eyes of the philosophe, probably for the first time since
the death of the giant, lost their pride. They gazed upon
Frowenfeld almost with piteousness; but she compressed her lips and
again slowly shook her head.</p>
<p>"You see," said Frowenfeld, suddenly feeling a new interest, "he
understands their wants. He knows their wrongs. He is acquainted
with laws and men. He could speak for them. It would not be
insurrection--it would be advocacy. He would give his time, his
pen, his speech, his means, to get them justice--to get them their
rights."</p>
<p>She hushed the over-zealous advocate with a sad and bitter smile
and essayed to speak, studied as if for English words, and,
suddenly abandoning that attempt, said, with ill-concealed scorn
and in the Creole patois:</p>

<b>"The tall figure of Palmyre rose slowly and silently from her
chair, her eyes lifted up and her lips moving noiselessly. She
seemed to have lost all knowledge of place or of human
presence".</b></p>
<br>
<p>"What is all that? What I want is vengeance!"</p>
<p>"I will finish reading," said Frowenfeld, quickly, not caring to
understand the passionate speech.</p>
<blockquote>"Ah, Palmyre! Palmyre! What you love and hope to love
you because his heart keep itself free, he is loving
another!"</blockquote>
<p><i>"Qui ci &ccedil;a, Mich&eacute;?"</i></p>
<p>Frowenfeld was loth to repeat. She had understood, as her face
showed; but she dared not believe. He made it shorter:</p>
<p>"He means that Honor&eacute; Grandissime loves another
woman."</p>
<p>"'Tis a lie!" she exclaimed, a better command of English coming
with the momentary loss of restraint.</p>
<p>The apothecary thought a moment and then decided to speak.</p>
<p>"I do not think so," he quietly said.</p>
<p>"'Ow you know dat?"</p>
<p>She, too, spoke quietly, but under a fearful strain. She had
thrown herself forward, but, as she spoke, forced herself back into
her seat.</p>
<p>"He told me so himself."</p>
<p>The tall figure of Palmyre rose slowly and silently from her
chair, her eyes lifted up and her lips moving noiselessly. She
seemed to have lost all knowledge of place or of human presence.
She walked down the drawing-room quite to its curtained windows and
there stopped, her face turned away and her hand laid with a
visible tension on the back of a chair. She remained so long that
Frowenfeld had begun to think of leaving her so, when she turned
and came back. Her form was erect, her step firm and nerved, her
lips set together and her hands dropped easily at her side; but
when she came close up before the apothecary she was trembling. For
a moment she seemed speechless, and then, while her eyes gleamed
with passion, she said, in a cold, clear tone, and in her native
patois:</p>
<p>"Very well: if I cannot love I can have my revenge." She took
the letter from him and bowed her thanks, still adding, in the same
tongue, "There is now no longer anything to prevent."</p>
<p>The apothecary understood the dark speech. She meant that, with
no hope of Honor&eacute;'s love, there was no restraining motive to
withhold her from wreaking what vengeance she could upon Agricola.
But he saw the folly of a debate.</p>
<p>"That is all I can do?" asked he.</p>
<p>"<i>Oui, merci, Mich&eacute;</i>" she said; then she added, in
perfect English, "but that is not all <i>I</i> can do," and
then--laughed.</p>
<p>The apothecary had already turned to go, and the laugh was a low
one; but it chilled his blood. He was glad to get back to his
employments.</p>

<h3>BUSINESS CHANGES</h3>
<br>
<p>We have now recorded some of the events which characterized the
five months during which Doctor Keene had been vainly seeking to
recover his health in the West Indies.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Frowenfeld in?" he asked, walking very slowly, and with
a cane, into the new drug-store on the morning of his return to the
city.</p>
<p>"If Professo' Frowenfel' 's in?" replied a young man in
shirt-sleeves, speaking rapidly, slapping a paper package which he
had just tied, and sliding it smartly down the counter. "No,
seh."</p>
<p>A quick step behind the doctor caused him to turn; Raoul was
just entering, with a bright look of business on his face, taking
his coat off as he came.</p>
<p>"Docta Keene! <i>Teck</i> a chair. 'Ow you like de noo sto'?
See? Fo' counters! T'ree clerk'! De whole interieure paint undre
mie h-own direction! If dat is not a beautiful! eh? Look at dat
sign."</p>
<p>He pointed to some lettering in harmonious colors near the
ceiling at the farther end of the house. The doctor looked and
read:</p>
<blockquote>MANDARIN, AG'T, APOTHECARY.</blockquote>
<p>"Why not Frowenfeld?" he asked.</p>
<p>Raoul shrugged.</p>
<p>"'Tis better dis way."</p>
<p>That was his explanation.</p>
<p>"Not the De Brahmin Mandarin who was Honor&eacute;'s
manager?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Honor&eacute; was n' able to kip 'im no long-er.
Honor&eacute; is n' so rich lak befo'."</p>
<p>"And Mandarin is really in charge here?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Profess-or Frowenfel' all de time at de ole corner,
w'ere 'e <i>con</i>tinue to keep 'is private room and h-use de ole
shop fo' ware'ouse. 'E h-only come yeh w'en Mandarin cann' git
'long widout 'im."</p>
<p>"What does he do there? <i>He's</i> not rich."</p>
<p>Raoul bent down toward the doctor's chair and whispered the dark
secret:</p>
<p>"Studyin'!"</p>
<p>Doctor Keene went out.</p>
<p>Everything seemed changed to the returned wanderer. Poor man!
The changes were very slight save in their altered relation to him.
To one broken in health, and still more to one with a broken heart,
old scenes fall upon the sight in broken rays. A sort of vague
alienation seemed to the little doctor to come like a film over the
long-familiar vistas of the town where he had once walked in the
vigor and complacency of strength and distinction. This was not the
same New Orleans. The people he met on the street were more or less
familiar to his memory, but many that should have recognized him
failed to do so, and others were made to notice him rather by his
cough than by his face. Some did not know he had been away. It made
him cross.</p>
<p>He had walked slowly down beyond the old Frowenfeld corner and
had just crossed the street to avoid the dust of a building which
was being torn down to make place for a new one, when he saw coming
toward him, unconscious of his proximity, Joseph Frowenfeld.</p>
<p>"Doctor Keene!" said Frowenfeld, with almost the enthusiasm of
Raoul.</p>
<p>The doctor was very much quieter.</p>
<p>"Hello, Joe."</p>
<p>They went back to the new drug-store, sat down in a pleasant
little rear corner enclosed by a railing and curtains, and
talked.</p>
<p>"And did the trip prove of no advantage to you?"</p>
<p>"You see. But never mind me; tell me about Honor&eacute;; how
does that row with his family progress?"</p>
<p>"It still continues; the most of his people hold ideas of
justice and prerogative that run parallel with family and party
lines, lines of caste, of custom and the like they have imparted
their bad feeling against him to the community at large; very easy
to do just now, for the election for President of the States comes
on in the fall, and though we in Louisiana have little or nothing
to do with it, the people are feverish."</p>
<p>"The country's chill-day," said Doctor Keene; "dumb chill, hot
fever."</p>
<p>"The excitement is intense," said Frowenfeld. "It seems we are
not to be granted suffrage yet; but the Creoles have a way of
casting votes in their mind. For example, they have voted
Honor&eacute; Grandissime a traitor; they have voted me an
encumbrance; I hear one of them casting that vote now."</p>
<p>Some one near the front of the store was talking excitedly with
Raoul:</p>
<p>"An'--an'--an' w'at are the consequence? The consequence are
that we smash his shop for him an' 'e 'ave to make a noo-start with
a Creole partner's money an' put 'is sto' in charge of Creole'! If
I know he is yo' frien'? Yesseh! Valuable citizen? An' w'at we care
for valuable citizen? Let him be valuable if he want; it keep' him
from gettin' the neck broke; but--he mus'-tek-kyeh--'ow--he--talk'!
He-mus'-tek-kyeh 'ow he stir the 'ot blood of Louisyanna!"</p>
<p>"He is perfectly right," said the little doctor, in his husky
undertone; "neither you nor Honor&eacute; is a bit sound, and I
shouldn't wonder if they would hang you both, yet; and as for that
darkey who has had the impudence to try to make a commercial white
gentleman of himself--it may not be I that ought to say it, but--he
will get his deserts--sure!"</p>
<p>"There are a great many Americans that think as you do," said
Frowenfeld, quietly.</p>
<p>"But," said the little doctor, "what did that fellow mean by
your Creole partner? Mandarin is in charge of your store, but he is
not your partner, is he? Have you one?"</p>
<p>"A silent one," said the apothecary</p>
<p>"So silent as to be none of my business?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, who is it, then?"</p>
<p>"It is Mademoiselle Nancanou."</p>
<p>"Your partner in business?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, Joseph Frowenfeld,--"</p>
<p>The insinuation conveyed in the doctor's manner was very trying,
but Joseph merely reddened.</p>
<p>"Purely business, I suppose," presently said the doctor, with a
ghastly ironical smile. "Does the arrangem'--" his utterance failed
him--"does it end there?"</p>
<p>"It ends there."</p>
<p>"And you don't see that it ought either not to have begun, or
else ought not to have ended there?"</p>
<p>Frowenfeld blushed angrily. The doctor asked:</p>
<p>"And who takes care of Aurora's money?"</p>
<p>"Herself."</p>
<p>"Exclusively?"</p>
<p>They both smiled more good-naturedly.</p>
<p>"Exclusively."</p>
<p>"She's a coon;" and the little doctor rose up and crawled away,
ostensibly to see another friend, but really to drag himself into
his bedchamber and lock himself in. The next day--the yellow fever
was bad again--he resumed the practice of his profession.</p>
<p>"'Twill be a sort of decent suicide without the element of
pusillanimity," he thought to himself.</p>

<h3>LOVE LIES A-BLEEDING</h3>
<br>
<p>When Honor&eacute; Grandissime heard that Doctor Keene had
returned to the city in a very feeble state of health, he rose at
once from the desk where he was sitting and went to see him; but it
was on that morning when the doctor was sitting and talking with
Joseph, and Honor&eacute; found his chamber door locked. Doctor
Keene called twice, within the following two days, upon
Honor&eacute; at his counting-room; but on both occasions
Honor&eacute;'s chair was empty. So it was several days before they
met. But one hot morning in the latter part of August,--the August
days were hotter before the cypress forest was cut down between the
city and the lake than they are now,--as Doctor Keene stood in the
middle of his room breathing distressedly after a sad fit of
coughing, and looking toward one of his windows whose closed sash
he longed to see opened, Honor&eacute; knocked at the door.</p>
<p>"Well, come in!" said the fretful invalid. "Why,
Honor&eacute;,--well, it serves you right for stopping to knock.
Sit down."</p>
<p>Each took a hasty, scrutinizing glance at the other; and, after
a pause, Doctor Keene said:</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;, you are pretty badly stove."</p>
<p>M. Grandissime smiled.</p>
<p>"Do you think so, Doctor? I will be more complimentary to you;
you might look more sick."</p>
<p>"Oh, I have resumed my trade," replied Doctor Keene.</p>
<p>"So I have heard; but, Charlie, that is all in favor of the
people who want a skilful and advanced physician and do not mind
killing him; I should advise you not to do it."</p>
<p>"You mean" (the incorrigible little doctor smiled cynically) "if
I should ask your advice. I am going to get well,
Honor&eacute;."</p>
<p>His visitor shrugged.</p>
<p>"So much the better. I do confess I am tempted to make use of
you in your official capacity, right now. Do you feel strong enough
to go with me in your gig a little way?"</p>
<p>"A professional call?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and a difficult case; also a confidential one."</p>
<p>"Ah! confidential!" said the little man, in his painful, husky
irony. "You want to get me into the sort of scrape I got our
'professor' into, eh?"</p>
<p>"Possibly a worse one," replied the amiable Creole.</p>
<p>"And I must be mum, eh?"</p>
<p>"I would prefer."</p>
<p>"Shall I need any instruments? No?"--with a shade of
disappointment on his face.</p>
<p>He pulled a bell-rope and ordered his gig to the street
door.</p>
<p>"How are affairs about town?" he asked, as he made some slight
preparation for the street.</p>
<p>"Excitement continues. Just as I came along, a private
difficulty between a Creole and an Am&eacute;ricain drew instantly
half the street together to take sides strictly according to
belongings and without asking a question. My-de'-seh, we are
having, as Frowenfeld says, a war of human acids and alkalies."</p>
<p>They descended and drove away. At the first corner the lad who
drove turned, by Honor&eacute;'s direction, toward the rue
Dauphine, entered it, passed down it to the rue Dumaine, turned
into this toward the river again and entered the rue Cond&eacute;.
The route was circuitous. They stopped at the carriage-door of a
large brick house. The wicket was opened by Clemence. They alighted
without driving in.</p>
<p>"Hey, old witch," said the doctor, with mock severity; "not hung
yet?"</p>
<p>The houses of any pretension to comfortable spaciousness in the
closely built parts of the town were all of the one, general,
Spanish-American plan. Honor&eacute; led the doctor through the
cool, high, tessellated carriage-hall, on one side of which were
the drawing-rooms, closed and darkened. They turned at the bottom,
ascended a broad, iron-railed staircase to the floor above, and
halted before the open half of a glazed double door with a clumsy
iron latch. It was the entrance to two spacious chambers, which
were thrown into one by folded doors.</p>
<p>The doctor made a low, indrawn whistle and raised his
eyebrows--the rooms were so sumptuously furnished; immovable
largeness and heaviness, lofty sobriety, abundance of finely
wrought brass mounting, motionless richness of upholstery, much
silent twinkle of pendulous crystal, a soft semi-obscurity--such
were the characteristics. The long windows of the farther apartment
could be seen to open over the street, and the air from behind,
coming in over a green mass of fig-trees that stood in the paved
court below, moved through the rooms, making them cool and
cavernous.</p>
<p>"You don't call this a hiding place, do you--in his own
bedchamber?" the doctor whispered.</p>
<p>"It is necessary, now, only to keep out of sight," softly
answered Honor&eacute;. "Agricole and some others ransacked this
house one night last March--the day I announced the new firm; but
of course, then, he was not here."</p>
<p>They entered, and the figure of Honor&eacute; Grandissime,
f.m.c., came into view in the centre of the farther room, reclining
in an attitude of extreme languor on a low couch, whither he had
come from the high bed near by, as the impression of his form among
its pillows showed. He turned upon the two visitors his slow,
melancholy eyes, and, without an attempt to rise or speak,
indicated, by a feeble motion of the hand, an invitation to be
seated.</p>
<p>"Good morning," said Doctor Keene, selecting a light chair and
drawing it close to the side of the couch.</p>
<p>The patient before him was emaciated. The limp and bloodless
hand, which had not responded to the doctor's friendly pressure but
sank idly back upon the edge of the couch, was cool and moist, and
its nails slightly blue.</p>
<p>"Lie still," said the doctor, reassuringly, as the rentier began
to lift the one knee and slippered foot which was drawn up on the
couch and the hand which hung out of sight across a large,
linen-covered cushion.</p>
<p>By pleasant talk that seemed all chat, the physician soon
acquainted himself with the case before him. It was a very plain
one. By and by he rubbed his face and red curls and suddenly
said:</p>
<p>"You will not take my prescription."</p>
<p>The f.m.c. did not say yes or no.</p>
<p>"Still,"--the doctor turned sideways in his chair, as was his
wont, and, as he spoke, allowed the corners of his mouth to take
that little satirical downward pull which his friends disliked,
"I'll do my duty. I'll give Honor&eacute; the details as to diet;
no physic; but my prescription to you is, Get up and get out. Never
mind the risk of rough handling; they can but kill you, and you
will die anyhow if you stay here." He rose. "I'll send you a
chalybeate tonic; or--I will leave it at Frowenfeld's to-morrow
morning, and you can call there and get it. It will give you an
object for going out."</p>

<b>"They turned in a direction opposite to the entrance and took
chairs in a cool nook of the paved court, at a small table where

lemonade".</b></p>
<br>
<p>The two visitors presently said adieu and retired together.
Reaching the bottom of the stairs in the carriage "corridor," they
turned in a direction opposite to the entrance and took chairs in a
cool nook of the paved court, at a small table where the
hospitality of Clemence had placed glasses of lemonade.</p>
<p>"No," said the doctor, as they sat down, "there is, as yet, no
incurable organic derangement; a little heart trouble easily
removed; still your--your patient--"</p>
<p>"My half-brother," said Honor&eacute;.</p>
<p>"Your patient," said Doctor Keene, "is an emphatic 'yes' to the
question the girls sometimes ask us doctors--Does love ever kill?'
It will kill him <i>soon</i>, if you do not get him to rouse up.
There is absolutely nothing the matter with him but his unrequited
love."</p>
<p>"Fortunately, the most of us," said Honor&eacute;, with
something of the doctor's smile, "do not love hard enough to be
killed by it."</p>
<p>"Very few." The doctor paused, and his blue eyes, distended in
reverie, gazed upon the glass which he was slowly turning around
with his attenuated fingers as it stood on the board, while he
added: "However, one <i>may</i> love as hopelessly and harder than
that man upstairs, and yet not die."</p>
<p>"There is comfort in that--to those who must live," said
Honor&eacute; with gentle gravity.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the other, still toying with his glass.</p>
<p>He slowly lifted his glance, and the eyes of the two men met and
remained steadfastly fixed each upon each.</p>
<p>"You've got it bad," said Doctor Keene, mechanically.</p>
<p>"And you?" retorted the Creole.</p>
<p>"It isn't going to kill me."</p>
<p>"It has not killed me. And," added M. Grandissime, as they
passed through the carriage-way toward the street, "while I keep in
mind the numberless other sorrows of life, the burials of wives and
sons and daughters, the agonies and desolations, I shall never die
of love, my-de'-seh, for very shame's sake."</p>
<p>This was much sentiment to risk within Doctor Keene's reach; but
he took no advantage of it.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;," said he, as they joined hands on the banquette
beside the doctor's gig, to say good-day, "if you think there's a
chance for you, why stickle upon such fine-drawn points as I reckon
you are making? Why, sir, as I understand it, this is the only weak
spot your action has shown; you have taken an inoculation of
Quixotic conscience from our transcendental apothecary and
perpetrated a lot of heroic behavior that would have done honor to
four-and-twenty Brutuses; and now that you have a chance to do
something easy and human, you shiver and shrink at the 'looks o'
the thing.' Why, what do you care--"</p>
<p>"Hush!" said Honor&eacute;; "do you suppose I have not
temptation enough already?"</p>
<p>He began to move away.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;," said the doctor, following him a step, "I
couldn't have made a mistake--It's the little Monk,--it's Aurora,
isn't it?"</p>
<p>Honor&eacute; nodded, then faced his friend more directly, with
a sudden new thought.</p>
<p>"But, Doctor, why not take your own advice? I know not how you
are prevented; you have as good a right as Frowenfeld."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be honest," said the doctor; "it wouldn't be the
straight up and down manly thing."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>The doctor stepped into his gig--</p>
<p>"Not till I feel all right <i>here</i>." (In his chest.)</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIII"></a>CHAPTER LIII</h2>
<h3>FROWENFELD AT THE GRANDISSIME MANSION</h3>
<br>
<p>One afternoon--it seems to have been some time in June, and
consequently earlier than Doctor Keene's return--the Grandissimes
were set all a-tremble with vexation by the discovery that another
of their number had, to use Agricola's expression, "gone over to
the enemy,"--a phrase first applied by him to Honor&eacute;.</p>
<p>"What do you intend to convey by that term?" Frowenfeld had
asked on that earlier occasion.</p>
<p>"Gone over to the enemy means, my son, gone over to the enemy!"
replied Agricola. "It implies affiliation with Am&eacute;ricains in
matters of business and of government! It implies the exchange of
social amenities with a race of upstarts! It implies a craven
consent to submit the sacredest prejudices of our fathers to the
new-fangled measuring-rods of pert, imported theories upon moral
and political progress! It implies a listening to, and reasoning
with, the condemners of some of our most time-honored and
respectable practices! Reasoning with? N-a-hay! but Honor&eacute;
has positively sat down and eaten with them! What?--and h-walked
out into the stre-heet with them, arm in arm! It implies in his
case an act--two separate and distinct acts--so base that--that--I
simply do not understand them! <i>H-you</i> know, Professor
Frowenfeld, what he has done! You know how ignominiously he has
surrendered the key of a moral position which for the honor of the
Grandissime-Fusilier name we have felt it necessary to hold against
our hereditary enemies! And--you--know--" here Agricola actually
dropped all artificiality and spoke from the depths of his
feelings, without figure--"h-h-he has joined himself in business
h-with a man of negro blood! What can we do? What can we say? It is
Honor&eacute; Grandissime. We can only say, 'Farewell! He is gone
over to the enemy.'"</p>
<p>The new cause of exasperation was the defection of Raoul
Innerarity. Raoul had, somewhat from a distance, contemplated such
part as he could understand of Joseph Frowenfeld's character with
ever-broadening admiration. We know how devoted he became to the
interests and fame of "Frowenfeld's." It was in April he had
married. Not to divide his generous heart he took rooms opposite
the drug-store, resolved that "Frowenfeld's" should be not only the
latest closed but the earliest opened of all the pharmacies in New
Orleans.</p>
<p>This, it is true, was allowable. Not many weeks afterward his
bride fell suddenly and seriously ill. The overflowing souls of
Aurora and Clotilde could not be so near to trouble and not know
it, and before Raoul was nearly enough recovered from the shock of
this peril to remember that he was a Grandissime, these last two of
the De Grapions had hastened across the street to the small,
white-walled sick-room and filled it as full of universal human
love as the cup of a magnolia is full of perfume. Madame Innerarity
recovered. A warm affection was all she and her husband could pay
such ministration in, and this they paid bountifully; the four
became friends. The little madame found herself drawn most toward
Clotilde; to her she opened her heart--and her wardrobe, and showed
her all her beautiful new underclothing. Raoul found Clotilde to
be, for him, rather--what shall we say?--starry; starrily
inaccessible; but Aurora was emphatically after his liking; he was
delighted with Aurora. He told her in confidence that "Profess-or
Frowenfel'" was the best man in the world; but she boldly said,
taking pains to speak with a tear-and-a-half of genuine
gratitude,--"Egcep' Monsieur Honor&eacute; Grandissime," and he
assented, at first with hesitation and then with ardor. The four
formed a group of their own; and it is not certain that this was
not the very first specimen ever produced in the Crescent City of
that social variety of New Orleans life now distinguished as Uptown
Creoles.</p>
<p>Almost the first thing acquired by Raoul in the camp of the
enemy was a certain Aurorean audacity; and on the afternoon to
which we allude, having told Frowenfeld a rousing fib to the effect
that the multitudinous inmates of the maternal Grandissime mansion
had insisted on his bringing his esteemed employer to see them, he
and his bride had the hardihood to present him on the front
veranda.</p>
<p>The straightforward Frowenfeld was much pleased with his
reception. It was not possible for such as he to guess the ire with
which his presence was secretly regarded. New Orleans, let us say
once more, was small, and the apothecary of the rue Royale locally
famed; and what with curiosity and that innate politeness which it
is the Creole's boast that he cannot mortify, the veranda, about
the top of the great front stair, was well crowded with people of
both sexes and all ages. It would be most pleasant to tarry once
more in description of this gathering of nobility and beauty; to
recount the points of Creole loveliness in midsummer dress; to tell
in particular of one and another eye-kindling face, form, manner,
wit; to define the subtle qualities of Creole air and sky and
scene, or the yet more delicate graces that characterize the music
of Creole voice and speech and the light of Creole eyes; to set
forth the gracious, unaccentuated dignity of the matrons and the
ravishing archness of their daughters. To Frowenfeld the experience
seemed all unreal. Nor was this unreality removed by conversation
on grave subjects; for few among either the maturer or the younger
beauty could do aught but listen to his foreign tongue like
unearthly strangers in the old fairy tales. They came, however, in
the course of their talk to the subject of love and marriage. It is
not certain that they entered deeper into the great question than a
comparison of its attendant Anglo-American and Franco-American
conventionalities; but sure it is that somehow--let those young
souls divine the method who can--every unearthly stranger on that
veranda contrived to understand Frowenfeld's English. Suddenly the
conversation began to move over the ground of inter-marriage
between hostile families. Then what eyes and ears! A certain
suspicion had already found lodgement in the universal Grandissime
breast, and every one knew in a moment that, to all intents and
purposes, they were about to argue the case of Honor&eacute; and
Aurora.</p>
<p>The conversation became discussion, Frowenfeld, Raoul and
Raoul's little seraph against the whole host, chariots, horse and
archery. Ah! such strokes as the apothecary dealt! And if Raoul and
"Madame Raoul" played parts most closely resembling the blowing of
horns and breaking of pitchers, still they bore themselves
gallantly. The engagement was short; we need not say that nobody
surrendered; nobody ever gives up the ship in parlor or veranda
debate: and yet--as is generally the case in such affairs--truth
and justice made some unacknowledged headway. If anybody on either
side came out wounded--this to the credit of the Creoles as a
people--the sufferer had the heroic good manners not to say so. But
the results were more marked than this; indeed, in more than one or
two candid young hearts and impressible minds the wrongs and rights
of sovereign true love began there on the spot to be more
generously conceded and allowed. "My-de'-seh," Honor&eacute; had
once on a time said to Frowenfeld, meaning that to prevail in
conversational debate one should never follow up a faltering
opponent, "you mus' <i>crack</i> the egg, not smash it!" And
Joseph, on rising to take his leave, could the more amiably
overlook the feebleness of the invitation to call again, since he
rejoiced, for Honor&eacute;'s sake, in the conviction that the egg
was cracked.</p>
<p>Agricola, the Grandissimes told the apothecary, was ill in his
room, and Madame de Grandissime, his sister--Honor&eacute;'s
mother--begged to be excused that she might keep him company. The
Fusiliers were a very close order; or one might say they garrisoned
the citadel.</p>
<p>But Joseph's rising to go was not immediately upon the close of
the discussion; those courtly people would not let even an
unwelcome guest go with the faintest feeling of disrelish for them.
They were casting about in their minds for some momentary diversion
with which to add a finishing touch to their guest's entertainment,
when Clemence appeared in the front garden walk and was quickly
surrounded by bounding children, alternately begging and demanding
a song. Many of even the younger adults remembered well when she
had been "one of the hands on the place," and a passionate lover of
the African dance. In the same instant half a dozen voices proposed
that for Joseph's amusement Clemence should put her cakes off her
head, come up on the veranda and show a few of her best steps.</p>
<p>"But who will sing?"</p>
<p>"Raoul!"</p>
<p>"Very well; and what shall it be?"</p>
<p>"'Madame Gaba.'"</p>
<p>No, Clemence objected.</p>
<p>"Well, well, stand back--something better than 'Madame
Gaba.'"</p>
<p>Raoul began to sing and Clemence instantly to pace and turn,
posture, bow, respond to the song, start, swing, straighten, stamp,
wheel, lift her hand, stoop, twist, walk, whirl, tiptoe with
crossed ankles, smite her palms, march, circle, leap,--an endless
improvisation of rhythmic motion to this modulated responsive
chant:</p>
<blockquote>Raoul. "<i>Mo pas l'aimein &ccedil;a</i>."<br>
<br>
Clemence. "<i>Mich&eacute; Igenne, oap! oap! oap!</i>"<br>
<br>
He. "<i>Y&eacute; donn&eacute; vingt cinq sous pou' manz&eacute;
poul&eacute;</i>."<br>
<br>
She. "<i>Mich&eacute; Igenne, dit--dit--dit--</i>"<br>
<br>
He. "<i>Mo pas l'aimein &ccedil;a!</i>"<br>
<br>
She. "<i>Mich&eacute; Igenne, oap! oap! oap!</i>"<br>
<br>
He. "<i>Mo pas l'aimein &ccedil;a!</i>"<br>
<br>
She. "<i>Mich&eacute; Igenne, oap! oap! oap!</i>"</blockquote>
<p>Frowenfeld was not so greatly amused as the ladies thought he
should have been, and was told that this was not a fair indication
of what he would see if there were ten dancers instead of one.</p>
<p>How much less was it an indication of what he would have seen in
that mansion early the next morning, when there was found just
outside of Agricola's bedroom door a fresh egg, not cracked,
according to Honor&eacute;'s maxim, but smashed, according to the
lore of the voudous. Who could have got in in the night? And did
the intruder get in by magic, by outside lock-picking, or by inside
collusion? Later in the morning, the children playing in the
basement found--it had evidently been accidentally dropped, since
the true use of its contents required them to be scattered in some
person's path--a small cloth bag, containing a quantity of dogs'
and cats' hair, cut fine and mixed with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>"Clemence?"</p>
<p>"Pooh! Clemence. No! But as sure as the sun turns around the
world--Palmyre Philosophe!"</p>

<h3>"CAULDRON BUBBLE"</h3>
<br>
<p>The excitement and alarm produced by the practical threat of
voudou curses upon Agricola was one thing, Creole lethargy was
quite another; and when, three mornings later, a full quartette of
voudou charms was found in the four corners of Agricola's pillow,
the great Grandissime family were ignorant of how they could have
come there. Let us examine these terrible engines of mischief. In
one corner was an acorn drilled through with two holes at right
angles to each other, a small feather run through each hole; in the
second a joint of cornstalk with a cavity scooped from the middle,
the pith left intact at the ends, and the space filled with parings
from that small callous spot near the knee of the horse, called the
"nail;" in the third corner a bunch of parti-colored feathers;
something equally meaningless in the fourth. No thread was used in
any of them. All fastening was done with the gum of trees. It was
no easy task for his kindred to prevent Agricola, beside himself
with rage and fright, from going straight to Palmyre's house and
shooting her down in open day.</p>
<p>"We shall have to watch our house by night," said a gentleman of
the household, when they had at length restored the Citizen to a
condition of mind which enabled them to hold him in a chair.</p>
<p>"Watch this house?" cried a chorus. "You don't suppose she comes
near here, do you? She does it all from a distance. No, no; watch
<i>her</i> house."</p>
<p>Did Agricola believe in the supernatural potency of these
gimcracks? No, and yes. Not to be foolhardy, he quietly slipped
down every day to the levee, had a slave-boy row him across the
river in a skiff, landed, re-embarked, and in the middle of the
stream surreptitiously cast a picayune over his shoulder into the
river. Monsieur D'Embarras, the imp of death thus placated, must
have been a sort of spiritual Cheap John.</p>
<p>Several more nights passed. The house of Palmyre, closely
watched, revealed nothing. No one came out, no one went in, no
light was seen. They should have watched in broad daylight. At
last, one midnight, 'Polyte Grandissime stepped cautiously up to
one of the batten doors with an auger, and succeeded, without
arousing any one, in boring a hole. He discovered a lighted candle
standing in a glass of water.</p>
<p>"Nothing but a bedroom light," said one.</p>
<p>"Ah, bah!" whispered the other; "it is to make the spell work
strong."</p>
<p>"We will not tell Agricola first; we had better tell
Honor&eacute;," said Sylvestre.</p>
<p>"You forget," said 'Polyte, "that I no longer have any
acquaintance with Monsieur Honor&eacute; Grandissime."</p>
<p>They told Agamemnon; and it would have gone hard with the
"<i>milatraise</i>" but for the additional fact that suspicion had
fastened upon another person; but now this person in turn had to be
identified. It was decided not to report progress to old Agricola,
but to wait and seek further developments. Agricola, having lost
all ability to sleep in the mansion, moved into a small cottage in
a grove near the house. But the very next morning, he turned cold
with horror to find on his doorstep a small black-coffined doll,
with pins run through the heart, a burned-out candle at the head
and another at the feet.</p>
<p>"You know it is Palmyre, do you?" asked Agamemnon, seizing the
old man as he was going at a headlong pace through the garden gate.
"What if I should tell you that by watching the Congo
dancing-ground at midnight to-night, you will see the real author
of this mischief--eh?"</p>
<p>"And why to-night?"</p>
<p>"Because the moon rises at midnight."</p>
<p>There was firing that night in the deserted Congo
dancing-grounds under the ruins of Fort St. Joseph, or, as we would
say now, in Congo Square, from three pistols--Agricola's,
'Polyte's, and the weapon of an ill-defined, retreating figure
answering the description of the person who had stabbed Agricola
the preceding February. "And yet," said 'Polyte, "I would have
sworn that it was Palmyre doing this work."</p>
<p>Through Raoul these events came to the ear of Frowenfield. It
was about the time that Raoul's fishing party, after a few days'
mishaps, had returned home. Palmyre, on several later dates, had
craved further audiences and shown other letters from the hidden
f.m.c. She had heard them calmly, and steadfastly preserved the one
attitude of refusal. But it could not escape Frowenfeld's notice
that she encouraged the sending of additional letters. He easily
guessed the courier to be Clemence; and now, as he came to ponder
these revelations of Raoul, he found that within twenty-four hours
after every visit of Clemence to the house of Palmyre, Agricola
suffered a visitation.</p>

<h3>CAUGHT</h3>
<br>
<p>The fig-tree, in Louisiana, sometimes sheds its leaves while it
is yet summer. In the rear of the Grandissme mansion, about two
hundred yards northwest of it and fifty northeast of the cottage in
which Agricola had made his new abode, on the edge of the grove of
which we have spoken, stood one of these trees, whose leaves were
beginning to lie thickly upon the ground beneath it. An ancient and
luxuriant hedge of Cherokee-rose started from this tree and
stretched toward the northwest across the level country, until it
merged into the green confusion of gardened homes in the vicinity
of Bayou St. Jean, or, by night, into the common obscurity of a
starlit perspective. When an unclouded moon shone upon it, it cast
a shadow as black as velvet.</p>
<p>Under this fig-tree, some three hours later than that at which
Honor&eacute; bade Joseph good-night, a man was stooping down and
covering something with the broad, fallen leaves.</p>
<p>"The moon will rise about three o'clock," thought he. "That, the
hour of universal slumber, will be, by all odds, the time most
likely to bring developments."</p>
<p>He was the same person who had spent the most of the day in a
blacksmith's shop in St. Louis street, superintending a piece of
smithing. Now that he seemed to have got the thing well hid, he
turned to the base of the tree and tried the security of some
attachment. Yes, it was firmly chained. He was not a robber; he was
not an assassin; he was not an officer of police; and what is more
notable, seeing he was a Louisianian, he was not a soldier nor even
an ex-soldier; and this although, under his clothing, he was
encased from head to foot in a complete suit of mail. Of steel? No.
Of brass? No. It was all one piece--<i>a white skin</i>; and on his
head he wore an invisible helmet--the name of Grandissime. As he
straightened up and withdrew into the grove, you would have
recognized at once--by his thick-set, powerful frame, clothed
seemingly in black, but really, as you might guess, in blue
cottonade, by his black beard and the general look of a seafarer--a
frequent visitor at the Grandissime mansion, a country member of
that great family, one whom we saw at the <i>f&ecirc;te de
grandp&egrave;re</i>.</p>
<p>Capitain Jean-Baptiste Grandissime was a man of few words, no
sentiments, short methods; materialistic, we might say; quietly
ferocious; indifferent as to means, positive as to ends, quick of
perception, sure in matters of saltpetre, a stranger at the
custom-house, and altogether--<i>take him right</i>--very much of a
gentleman. He had been, for a whole day, beset with the idea that
the way to catch a voudou was--to catch him; and as he had caught
numbers of them on both sides of the tropical and semi-tropical
Atlantic, he decided to try his skill privately on the one who--his
experience told him--was likely to visit Agricola's doorstep
to-night. All things being now prepared, he sat down at the root of
a tree in the grove, where the shadow was very dark, and seemed
quite comfortable. He did not strike at the mosquitoes; they
appeared to understand that he did not wish to trifle. Neither did
his thoughts or feelings trouble him; he sat and sharpened a small
penknife on his boot.</p>
<p>His mind--his occasional transient meditation--was the more
comfortable because he was one of those few who had coolly and
unsentimentally allowed Honor&eacute; Grandissime to sell their
lands. It continued to grow plainer every day that the grants with
which theirs were classed--grants of old French or Spanish
under-officials--were bad. Their sagacious cousin seemed to have
struck the right standard, and while those titles which he still
held on to remained unimpeached, those that he had parted with to
purchasers--as, for instance, the grant held by this Capitain
Jean-Baptiste Grandissime--could be bought back now for half what
he had got for it. Certainly, as to that, the Capitain might well
have that quietude of mind which enabled him to find occupation in
perfecting the edge of his penknife and trimming his nails in the
dark.</p>
<p>By and by he put up the little tool and sat looking out upon the
prospect. The time of greatest probability had not come, but the
voudou might choose not to wait for that; and so he kept watch.
There was a great stillness. The cocks had finished a round and
were silent. No dog barked. A few tiny crickets made the quiet land
seem the more deserted. Its beauties were not entirely
overlooked--the innumerable host of stars above, the twinkle of
myriad fireflies on the dark earth below. Between a quarter and a
half-mile away, almost in a line with the Cherokee hedge, was a
faint rise of ground, and on it a wide-spreading live-oak. There
the keen, seaman's eye of the Capitain came to a stop, fixed upon a
spot which he had not noticed before. He kept his eye on it, and
waited for the stronger light of the moon.</p>
<p>Presently behind the grove at his back she rose; and almost the
first beam that passed over the tops of the trees, and stretched
across the plain, struck the object of his scrutiny. What was it?
The ground, he knew; the tree, he knew; he knew there ought to be a
white paling enclosure about the trunk of the tree: for there were
buried--ah!--he came as near laughing at himself as ever he did in
his life; the apothecary of the rue Royale had lately erected some
marble headstones there, and--</p>
<p>"Oh! my God!"</p>
<p>While Capitain Jean-Baptiste had been trying to guess what the
tombstones were, a woman had been coming toward him in the shadow
of the hedge. She was not expecting to meet him; she did not know
that he was there; she knew she had risks to run, but was ignorant
of what they were; she did not know there was anything under the
fig-tree which she so nearly and noiselessly approached. One moment
her foot was lifted above the spot where the unknown object lay
with wide-stretched jaws under the leaves, and the next, she
uttered that cry of agony and consternation which interrupted the
watcher's meditation. She was caught in a huge steel-trap.</p>
<p>Capitain Jean-Baptiste Grandissime remained perfectly still. She
fell, a snarling, struggling, groaning heap, to the ground, wild
with pain and fright, and began the hopeless effort to draw the
jaws of the trap apart with her fingers.</p>
<p>"<i>Ah! bon Dieu, bon Dieu!</i> Quit a-<i>bi-i-i-i-tin' me</i>!
Oh! Lawd 'a' mussy! Ow-ow-ow! lemme go! Dey go'n' to kyetch an'
hang me! Oh! an' I hain' done nutt'n' 'gainst <i>no</i>body! Ah!

Oh Lawd, oh <i>Lawd</i>, you'll be mighty good ef you lemme loose!
I'm a po' nigga! Oh! dey had n' ought to mek it so
<i>pow</i>'ful!"</p>
<p>Hands, teeth, the free foot, the writhing body, every
combination of available forces failed to spread the savage jaws,
though she strove until hands and mouth were bleeding.</p>
<p>Suddenly she became silent; a thought of precaution came to her;
she lifted from the earth a burden she had dropped there, struggled
to a half-standing posture, and, with her foot still in the trap,
was endeavoring to approach the end of the hedge near by, to thrust
this burden under it, when she opened her throat in a speechless
ecstasy of fright on feeling her arm grasped by her captor.</p>
<p>"O-o-o-h! Lawd! o-o-oh! Lawd!" she cried, in a frantic, husky
whisper, going down upon her knees, "<i>Oh, Mich&eacute;! pou'
l'amou' du bon Dieu! Pou' l'amou du bon Dieu ayez piti&eacute;

<p>"<i>Qui ci &ccedil;a?</i>" asked the Capitain, sternly, stooping
and grasping her burden, which she had been trying to conceal under
herself.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mich&eacute;, don' trouble dat! Please jes tek dis yeh trap
offen me--da's all! Oh, don't, mawstah, ple-e-ease don' spill all

sacre</i>--I'll kiss de cross! Oh, <i>sweet Mich&eacute; Jean,
laisse moi aller</i>! Nutt'n' but some dutty close <i>la-dans</i>."
She repeated this again and again, even after Capitain
Jean-Baptiste had disengaged a small black coffin from the old
dress in which it was wrapped. "<i>Rien du tout, Mich&eacute;</i>;
nutt'n' but some wash'n' fo' one o' de boys."</p>
<p>He removed the lid and saw within, resting on the cushioned
bottom, the image, in myrtle-wax, moulded and painted with some
rude skill, of a negro's bloody arm cut off near the shoulder--a
<i>bras coup&eacute;</i>--with a dirk grasped in its hand.</p>
<p>The old woman lifted her eyes to heaven; her teeth chattered;
she gasped twice before she could recover utterance. "<i>Oh,
Mich&eacute;</i> Jean-Baptiste, I di' n' mek dat ah! <i>Mo'
t&eacute; pas f&eacute; &ccedil;a</i>! I swea' befo' God! Oh, no,
no, no! 'Tain' nutt'n' nohow but a lill play-toy,

Jean</i>--ef you lemme go! Sho's God's good to me--ef you lemme go!
Oh, God A'mighty, <i>Mich&eacute; Jean</i>, sho's God's good to
me."</p>
<p>She was becoming incoherent.</p>
<p>Then Capitain Jean-Baptiste Grandissime for the first time spoke
at length:</p>
<p>"Do you see this?" he spoke the French of the Atchafalaya. He
put his long flintlock pistol close to her face. "I shall take the
trap off; you will walk three feet in front of me; if you make it
four I blow your brains out; we shall go to Agricole. But right
here, just now, before I count ten, you will tell me who sent you
here; at the word ten, if I reach it, I pull the trigger.
One--two--three--"</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>Mich&eacute;</i>, she gwan to gib me to de devil wid
<i>houdou</i> ef I tell you--Oh, good <i>Lawdy</i>!"</p>
<p>But he did not pause.</p>
<p>"Four--five--six--seven--eight--"</p>
<p>"Palmyre!" gasped the negress, and grovelled on the ground.</p>
<p>The trap was loosened from her bleeding leg, the burden placed
in her arms, and they disappeared in the direction of the
mansion.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>A black shape, a boy, the lad who had carried the basil to
Frowenfeld, rose up from where he had all this time lain, close
against the hedge, and glided off down its black shadow to warn the
philosophe.</p>
<p>When Clemence was searched, there was found on her person an old
table-knife with its end ground to a point.</p>

<h3>BLOOD FOR A BLOW</h3>
<br>
<p>It seems to be one of the self-punitive characteristics of
tyranny, whether the tyrant be a man, a community, or a caste, to
have a pusillanimous fear of its victim. It was not when Clemence
lay in irons, it is barely now, that our South is casting off a
certain apprehensive tremor, generally latent, but at the slightest
provocation active, and now and then violent, concerning her
"blacks." This fear, like others similar elsewhere in the world,
has always been met by the same one antidote--terrific cruelty to
the tyrant's victim. So we shall presently see the Grandissime
ladies, deeming themselves compassionate, urging their kinsmen to
"give the poor wretch a sound whipping and let her go." Ah! what
atrocities are we unconsciously perpetrating North and South now,
in the name of mercy or defence, which the advancing light of
progressive thought will presently show out in their enormity?</p>
<p>Agricola slept late. He had gone to his room the evening before
much incensed at the presumption of some younger Grandissimes who
had brought up the subject, and spoken in defence, of their cousin
Honor&eacute;. He had retired, however, not to rest, but to
construct an engine of offensive warfare which would revenge him a
hundred-fold upon the miserable school of imported thought which
had sent its revolting influences to the very Grandissime
hearthstone; he wrote a "<i>Phillipique G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
contre la Conduite du Gouvernement de la Louisiane</i>" and a short
but vigorous chapter in English on "The Insanity of Educating the
Masses." This accomplished, he had gone to bed in a condition of
peaceful elation, eager for the next day to come that he might take
these mighty productions to Joseph Frowenfeld, and make him a
present of them for insertion in his book of tables.</p>
<p>Jean-Baptiste felt no need of his advice, that he should rouse
him; and, for a long time before the old man awoke, his younger
kinsmen were stirring about unwontedly, going and coming through
the hall of the mansion, along its verandas and up and down its
outer flight of stairs. Gates were opening and shutting, errands
were being carried by negro boys on bareback horses, Charlie
Mandarin of St. Bernard parish and an Armand Fusilier from Faubourg
Ste. Marie had on some account come--as they told the ladies--"to
take breakfast;" and the ladies, not yet informed, amusedly
wondering at all this trampling and stage whispering, were up a
trifle early. In those days Creole society was a ship, in which the
fair sex were all passengers and the ruder sex the crew. The ladies
of the Grandissime mansion this morning asked passengers'
questions, got sailors' answers, retorted wittily and more or less
satirically, and laughed often, feeling their constrained
insignificance. However, in a house so full of bright-eyed
children, with mothers and sisters of all ages as their
confederates, the secret was soon out, and before Agricola had left
his little cottage in the grove the topic of all tongues was the
abysmal treachery and <i>ingratitude</i> of negro slaves. The whole
tribe of Grandissime believed, this morning, in the doctrine of
total depravity--of the negro.</p>
<p>And right in the face of this belief, the ladies put forth the
generously intentioned prayer for mercy. They were answered that
they little knew what frightful perils they were thus inviting upon
themselves.</p>
<p>The male Grandissimes were not surprised at this exhibition of
weak clemency in their lovely women; they were proud of it; it
showed the magnanimity that was natural to the universal
Grandissime heart, when not restrained and repressed by the stern
necessities of the hour. But Agricola disappointed them. Why should
he weaken and hesitate, and suggest delays and middle courses, and
stammer over their proposed measures as "extreme"? In very truth,
it seemed as though that drivelling, woman-beaten Deutsch
apotheke--ha! ha! ha!--in the rue Royale had bewitched Agricola as
well as Honor&eacute;. The fact was, Agricola had never got over
the interview which had saved Sylvestre his life.</p>
<p>"Here, Agricole," his kinsmen at length said, "you see you are
too old for this sort of thing; besides, it would be bad taste for
you, who might be presumed to harbor feelings of revenge, to have a
voice in this council." And then they added to one another: "We
will wait until 'Polyte reports whether or not they have caught
Palmyre; much will depend on that."</p>
<p>Agricola, thus ruled out, did a thing he did not fully
understand; he rolled up the "<i>Philippique
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>" and "The Insanity of Educating the
Masses," and, with these in one hand and his staff in the other,
set out for Frowenfeld's, not merely smarting but trembling under
the humiliation of having been sent, for the first time in his
life, to the rear as a non-combatant.</p>
<p>He found the apothecary among his clerks, preparing with his own
hands the "chalybeate tonic" for which the f.m.c. was expected to
call. Raoul Innerarity stood at his elbow, looking on with an
amiable air of having been superseded for the moment by his
master.</p>
<p>"Ha-ah! Professor Frowenfeld!"</p>
<p>The old man nourished his scroll.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld said good-morning, and they shook hands across the
counter; but the old man's grasp was so tremulous that the
apothecary looked at him again.</p>
<p>"Does my hand tremble, Joseph? It is not strange; I have had
much to excite me this morning."</p>
<p>"Wat's de mattah?" demanded Raoul, quickly.</p>
<p>"My life--which I admit, Professor Frowenfeld, is of little
value compared with such a one as yours--has been--if not
attempted, at least threatened."</p>
<p>"How?" cried Raoul.</p>
<p>"H-really, Professor, we must agree that a trifle like that
ought not to make old Agricola Fusilier nervous. But I find it
painful, sir, very painful. I can lift up this right hand, Joseph,
and swear I never gave a slave--man or woman--a blow in my life but
according to my notion of justice. And now to find my life
attempted by former slaves of my own household, and taunted with
the righteous hamstringing of a dangerous runaway! But they have
apprehended the miscreants; one is actually in hand, and justice
will take its course; trust the Grandissimes for that--though,
really, Joseph, I assure you, I counselled leniency."</p>
<p>"Do you say they have caught her?" Frowenfeld's question was
sudden and excited; but the next moment he had controlled
himself.</p>
<p>"H-h-my son, I did not say it was a 'her'!"</p>
<p>"Was it not Clemence? Have they caught her?"</p>
<p>"H-yes--"</p>
<p>The apothecary turned to Raoul.</p>
<p>"Go tell Honor&eacute; Grandissime."</p>
<p>"But, Professor Frowenfeld--" began Agricola.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld turned to repeat his instruction, but Raoul was
already leaving the store.</p>
<p>Agricola straightened up angrily.</p>
<p>"Pro-hofessor Frowenfeld, by what right do you interfere?"</p>
<p>"No matter," said the apothecary, turning half-way and pouring
the tonic into a vial.</p>
<p>"Sir," thundered the old lion, "h-I demand of you to answer! How
dare you insinuate that my kinsmen may deal otherwise than
justly?"</p>
<p>"Will they treat her exactly as if she were white, and had
threatened the life of a slave?" asked Frowenfeld from behind the
desk at the end of the counter.</p>
<p>The old man concentrated all the indignation of his nature in
the reply.</p>
<p>"No-ho, sir!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, a shadow approaching from the door caused him to
turn. The tall, dark, finely clad form of the f.m.c, in its old
soft-stepping dignity and its sad emaciation, came silently toward
the spot where he stood.</p>
<p>Frowenfeld saw this, and hurried forward inside the counter with
the preparation in his hand.</p>
<p>"Professor Frowenfeld," said Agricola, pointing with his ugly
staff, "I demand of you, as a keeper of a white man's pharmacy, to
turn that negro out."</p>
<p>"Citizen Fusilier!" exclaimed the apothecary; "Mister
Grandis--"</p>
<p>He felt as though no price would be too dear at that moment to
pay for the presence of the other Honor&eacute;. He had to go clear
to the end of the counter and come down the outside again to reach
the two men. They did not wait for him. Agricola turned upon the
f.m.c.</p>
<p>"Take off your hat!"</p>
<p>A sudden activity seized every one connected with the
establishment as the quadroon let his thin right hand slowly into
his bosom, and answered in French, in his soft, low voice:</p>
<p>"I wear my hat on my head."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld was hurrying toward them; others stepped forward, and
from two or three there came half-uttered exclamations of protest;
but unfortunately nothing had been done or said to provoke any one
to rush upon them, when Agricola suddenly advanced a step and
struck the f.m.c. on the head with his staff. Then the general
outcry and forward rush came too late; the two crashed together and
fell, Agricola above, the f.m.c. below, and a long knife lifted up
from underneath sank to its hilt, once--twice--thrice,--in the old
man's back.</p>
<p>The two men rose, one in the arms of his friends, the other upon
his own feet. While every one's attention was directed toward the
wounded man, his antagonist restored his dagger to its sheath, took
up his hat and walked away unmolested. When Frowenfeld, with
Agricola still in his arms, looked around for the quadroon, he was
gone.</p>
<p>Doctor Keene, sent for instantly, was soon at Agricola's
side.</p>
<p>"Take him upstairs; he can't be moved any further."</p>
<p>Frowenfeld turned and began to instruct some one to run upstairs
and ask permission, but the little doctor stopped him.</p>
<p>"Joe, for shame! you don't know those women better than that?
Take the old man right up!"</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVII"></a>CHAPTER LVII</h2>
<h3>VOUDOU CURED</h3>
<br>
<p>"Honor&eacute;," said Agricola, faintly, "where is
Honor&eacute;!"</p>
<p>"He has been sent for," said Doctor Keene and the two ladies in
a breath.</p>
<p>Raoul, bearing the word concerning Clemence, and the later
messenger summoning him to Agricola's bedside, reached
Honor&eacute; within a minute of each other. His instructions were
quickly given, for Raoul to take his horse and ride down to the
family mansion, to break gently to his mother the news of
Agricola's disaster, and to say to his kinsmen with imperative
emphasis, not to touch the <i>marchande des calas</i> till he
should come. Then he hurried to the rue Royale.</p>
<p>But when Raoul arrived at the mansion he saw at a glance that
the news had outrun him. The family carriage was already coming
round the bottom of the front stairs for three Mesdames Grandissime
and Madame Martinez. The children on all sides had dropped their
play, and stood about, hushed and staring. The servants moved with
quiet rapidity. In the hall he was stopped by two beautiful
girls.</p>
<p>"Raoul! Oh, Raoul, how is he now? Oh! Raoul, if you could only
stop them! They have taken old Clemence down into the swamp--as
soon as they heard about Agricole--Oh, Raoul, surely that would be
cruel! She nursed me--and me--when we were babies!"</p>
<p>"Where is Agamemnon?"</p>
<p>"Gone to the city."</p>
<p>"What did he say about it?"</p>
<p>"He said they were doing wrong, that he did not approve their
action, and that they would get themselves into trouble: that he
washed his hands of it."</p>
<p>"Ah-h-h!" exclaimed Raoul, "wash his hands! Oh, yes, wash his
hands? Suppose we all wash our hands? But where is Valentine? Where
is Charlie Mandarin?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Valentine is gone with Agamemnon, saying the same thing,
and Charlie Mandarin is down in the swamp, the worst of all of
them!"</p>
<p>"But why did you let Agamemnon and Valentine go off that way,
you?"</p>
<p>"Ah! listen to Raoul! What can a woman do?"</p>
<p>"What can a woman--Well, even if I was a woman, I would do
something!"</p>
<p>He hurried from the house, leaped into the saddle and galloped
across the fields toward the forest.</p>
<p>Some rods within the edge of the swamp, which, at this season,
was quite dry in many places, on a spot where the fallen dead
bodies of trees overlay one another and a dense growth of willows
and vines and dwarf palmetto shut out the light of the open fields,
the younger and some of the harsher senior members of the
Grandissime family were sitting or standing about, in an irregular
circle whose centre was a big and singularly misshapen
water-willow. At the base of this tree sat Clemence, motionless and
silent, a wan, sickly color in her face, and that vacant look in
her large, white-balled, brown-veined eyes, with which
hope-forsaken cowardice waits for death. Somewhat apart from the
rest, on an old cypress stump, half-stood, half-sat, in whispered
consultation, Jean-Baptiste Grandissime and Charlie Mandarin.</p>
<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>, old woman," said Mandarin, turning, without
rising, and speaking sharply in the negro French, "have you any
reason to give why you should not be hung to that limb over your
head?"</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes slowly to his, and made a feeble gesture of
deprecation.</p>
<p>"<i>Mo t&eacute; pas f&eacute; cette bras</i>, Mawse Challie--I
di'n't mek dat ahm; no 'ndeed I di'n', Mawse Challie. I ain' wuth
hangin', gen'lemen; you'd oughteh jis gimme fawty an' lemme go.

'mongs' de sojer boys to sell my cakes, you know, and da's de
onyest reason why I cyah dat ah ole fool knife." She seemed to take
some hope from the silence with which they heard her. Her eye
brightened and her voice took a tone of excitement. "You'd oughteh
tek me and put me in calaboose, an' let de law tek 'is co'se. You's
all nice gen'lemen--werry nice gen'lemen, an' you sorter owes it to
yo'sev's fo' to not do no sich nasty wuck as hangin' a po' ole

gave a start, and cast a furtive glance of alarm behind her. "Yes,
we is; you jis' oughteh gimme fawty an' lemme go! Please,
gen'lemen! God'll be good to you, you nice, sweet gen'lemen!"</p>
<p>Charlie Mandarin made a sign to one who stood at her back, who
responded by dropping a rawhide noose over her head. She bounded up
with a cry of terror; it may be that she had all along hoped that
all was make-believe. She caught the noose wildly with both hands
and tried to lift it over her head.</p>
<p>"Ah! no, mawsteh, you cyan' do dat! It's ag'in' de law! I's
'bleeged to have my trial, yit. Oh, no, no! Oh, good God, no! Even

fo', fo', de, de, <i>love 0' God! Oh</i>!"</p>
<p>They drew her up.</p>
<p>Raoul was not far off. He heard the woman's last cry, and came
threshing through the bushes on foot. He saw Sylvestre, unconscious
of any approach, spring forward, jerk away the hands that had drawn
the thong over the branch, let the strangling woman down and loosen
the noose. Her eyes, starting out with horror, turned to him; she
fell on her knees and clasped her hands. The tears were rolling
down Sylvestre's face.</p>
<p>"My friends, we must not do this! You <i>shall</i> not do
it!"</p>
<p>He hurled away, with twice his natural strength, one who put out
a hand.</p>
<p>"No, sirs!" cried Raoul, "you shall not do it! I come from
Honor&eacute;! Touch her who dares!"</p>
<p>He drew a weapon.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Innerarity," said 'Polyte, "<i>who is</i> Monsieur
Honor&eacute; Grandissime? There are two of the name, you
know,--partners--brothers. Which of--but it makes no difference;
before either of them sees this assassin she is going to be a lump
of nothing!"</p>
<p>The next word astonished every one. It was Charlie Mandarin who
spoke.</p>
<p>"Let her go!"</p>
<p>"Let her go!" said Jean-Baptiste Grandissime; "give her a run
for life. Old woman, rise up. We propose to let you go. Can you
run? Never mind, we shall see. Achille, put her upon her feet. Now,
old woman, run!"</p>
<p>She walked rapidly, but with unsteady feet, toward the
fields.</p>
<p>"Run! If you don't run I will shoot you this minute!"</p>
<p>She ran.</p>
<p>"Faster!"</p>
<p>She ran faster.</p>
<p>"Run!"</p>
<p>"Run!"</p>
<p>"Run, Clemence! Ha, ha, ha!" It was so funny to see her
scuttling and tripping and stumbling. "<i>Courri! courri, Clemence!
c'est pou to' vie!</i> ha, ha, ha--"</p>
<p>A pistol-shot rang out close behind Raoul's ear; it was never
told who fired it. The negress leaped into the air and fell at full
length to the ground, stone dead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVIII"></a>CHAPTER LVIII</h2>
<h3>DYING WORDS</h3>
<br>
<p>Drivers of vehicles in the rue Royale turned aside before two
slight barriers spanning the way, one at the corner below, the
other at that above, the house where the aged high-priest of a
doomed civilization lay bleeding to death. The floor of the store
below, the pavement of the corridor where stood the idle volante,
were covered with straw, and servants came and went by the
beckoning of the hand.</p>
<p>"This way," whispered a guide of the four ladies from the
Grandissime mansion. As Honor&eacute;'s mother turned the angle
half-way up the muffled stair, she saw at the landing above,
standing as if about to part, yet in grave council, a man and a
woman, the fairest--she noted it even in this moment of extreme
distress--she had ever looked upon. He had already set one foot
down upon the stair, but at sight of the ascending group drew back
and said:</p>
<p>"It is my mother;" then turned to his mother and took her hand;
they had been for months estranged, but now they silently
kissed.</p>
<p>"He is sleeping," said Honor&eacute;. "Maman, Madame
Nancanou."</p>
<p>The ladies bowed--the one looking very large and splendid, the
other very sweet and small. There was a single instant of silence,
and Aurora burst into tears.</p>
<p>For a moment Madame Grandissime assumed a frown that was almost
a reminder of her brother's, and then the very pride of the
Fusiliers broke down. She uttered an inaudible exclamation, drew
the weeper firmly into her bosom, and with streaming eyes and
choking voice, but yet with majesty, whispered, laying her hand on
Aurora's head:</p>
<p>"Never mind, my child; never mind; never mind."</p>
<p>And Honor&eacute;'s sister, when she was presently introduced,
kissed Aurora and murmured:</p>
<p>"The good God bless thee! It is He who has brought us
together."</p>
<p>"Who is with him just now?" whispered the two other ladies,
while Honor&eacute; and his mother stood a moment aside in hurried
consultation.</p>
<p>"My daughter," said Aurora, "and--"</p>
<p>"Agamemnon," suggested Madame Martinez.</p>
<p>"I believe so," said Aurora.</p>
<p>Valentine appeared from the direction of the sick-room and
beckoned to Honor&eacute;. Doctor Keene did the same and continued
to advance.</p>
<p>"Awake?" asked Honor&eacute;.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Alas! my brother!" said Madame Grandissime, and started
forward, followed by the other women.</p>
<p>"Wait," said Honor&eacute;, and they paused. "Charlie," he said,
as the little doctor persistently pushed by him at the head of the
stair.</p>
<p>"Oh, there's no chance, Honor&eacute;, you'd as well all go in
there."</p>
<p>They gathered into the room and about the bed. Madame
Grandissime bent over it.</p>
<p>"Ah! sister," said the dying man, "is that you? I had the
sweetest dream just now--just for a minute." He sighed. "I feel
very weak. Where is Charlie Keene?"</p>
<p>He had spoken in French; he repeated his question in English. He
thought he saw the doctor.</p>
<p>"Charlie, if I must meet the worst I hope you will tell me so; I
am fully prepared. Ah! excuse--I thought it was--</p>
<p>"My eyes seem dim this evening. <i>Est-ce-vous</i>,
Honor&eacute;? Ah, Honor&eacute;, you went over to the enemy, did
you?--Well,--the Fusilier blood would al--ways--do as it pleased.
Here's your old uncle's hand, Honor&eacute;. I forgive you,
Honor&eacute;--my noble-hearted, foolish--boy." He spoke feebly,
and with great nervousness.</p>
<p>"Water."</p>
<p>It was given him by Aurora. He looked in her face; they could
not be sure whether he recognized her or not. He sank back, closed
his eyes, and said, more softly and dreamily, as if to himself, "I
forgive everybody. A man must die--I forgive--even the enemies--of
Louisiana."</p>
<p>He lay still a few moments, and then revived excitedly.
"Honor&eacute;! tell Professor Frowenfeld to take care of that
<i>Philippique G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>. 'Tis a grand thing,
Honor&eacute;, on a grand theme! I wrote it myself in one evening.
Your Yankee Government is a failure, Honor&eacute;, a drivelling
failure. It may live a year or two, not longer. Truth will triumph.
The old Louisiana will rise again. She will get back her trampled
rights. When she does, remem'--" His voice failed, but he held up
one finger firmly by way of accentuation.</p>
<p>There was a stir among the kindred. Surely this was a turn for
the better. The doctor ought to be brought back. A little while ago
he was not nearly so strong. "Ask Honor&eacute; if the doctor
should not come." But Honor&eacute; shook his head. The old man
began again.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;! Where is Honor&eacute;? Stand by me, here,
Honor&eacute;; and sister?--on this other side. My eyes are very
poor to-day. Why do I perspire so? Give me a drink. You see--I am
better now; I have ceased--to throw up blood. Nay, let me talk." He
sighed, closed his eyes, and opened them again suddenly. "Oh,
Honor&eacute;, you and the Yankees--you and--all--going
wrong--education--masses--weaken--caste--indiscr'--quarrels
settl'--by affidav'--Oh! Honor&eacute;."</p>
<p>"If he would only forget," said one, in an agonized whisper,
"that <i>philippique g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>!"</p>
<p>Aurora whispered earnestly and tearfully to Madame Grandissime.
Surely they were not going to let him go thus! A priest could at
least do no harm. But when the proposition was made to him by his
sister, he said:</p>
<p>"No;--no priest. You have my will, Honor&eacute;,--in your iron
box. Professor Frowenfeld,"--he changed his speech to English,--"I
have written you an article on--" his words died on his lips.</p>
<p>"Joseph, son, I do not see you. Beware, my son, of the doctrine
of equal rights--a bottomless iniquity. Master and man--arch and
pier--arch above--pier below." He tried to suit the gesture to the
words, but both hands and feet were growing uncontrollably
restless.</p>
<p>"Society, Professor,"--he addressed himself to a weeping
girl,--"society has pyramids to build which make menials a
necessity, and Nature furnishes the menials all in dark uniform.
She--I cannot tell you--you will find--all in the <i>Philippique
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>. Ah! Honor&eacute;, is it--"</p>
<p>He suddenly ceased.</p>
<p>"I have lost my glasses."</p>
<p>Beads of sweat stood out upon his face. He grew frightfully
pale. There was a general dismayed haste, and they gave him a
stimulant.</p>
<p>"Brother," said the sister, tenderly.</p>
<p>He did not notice her.</p>
<p>"Agamemnon! Go and tell Jean-Baptiste--" his eyes drooped and
flashed again wildly.</p>
<p>"I am here, Agricole," said the voice of Jean-Baptiste, close
beside the bed.</p>
<p>"I told you to let--that negress--"</p>
<p>"Yes, we have let her go. We have let all of them go."</p>
<p>"All of them," echoed the dying man, feebly, with wandering
eyes. Suddenly he brightened again and tossed his arms. "Why, there
you were wrong, Jean-Baptiste; the community must be protected."
His voice sank to a murmur. "He would not take off--'you must
remem'--" He was silent. "You must remem'--those people are--are
not--white people." He ceased a moment. "Where am I going?" He
began evidently to look, or try to look, for some person; but they
could not divine his wish until, with piteous feebleness, he
called:</p>
<p>"Aurore De Grapion!"</p>
<p>So he had known her all the time.</p>
<p>Honor&eacute;'s mother had dropped on her knees beside the bed,
dragging Aurora down with her.</p>
<p>They rose together.</p>
<p>The old man groped distressfully with one hand. She laid her own
in it.</p>
<p>"Honor&eacute;!</p>
<p>"What could he want?" wondered the tearful family. He was
feeling about with the other hand.</p>
<p>"Hon'--Honor&eacute;"--his weak clutch could scarcely close upon
his nephew's hand.</p>
<p>"Put them--put--put them--"</p>
<p>What could it mean? The four hands clasped.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said one, with fresh tears, "he is trying to speak and
cannot."</p>
<p>But he did.</p>
<p>"Aurora De Gra--I pledge'--pledge'--pledged--this union--to your
fa'--father--twenty--years--ago."</p>
<p>The family looked at each other in dejected amazement. They had
never known it.</p>
<p>"He is going," said Agamemnon; and indeed it seemed as though he
was gone; but he rallied.</p>
<p>"Agamemnon! Valentine! Honor&eacute;! patriots! protect the
race! Beware of the"--that sentence escaped him. He seemed to fancy
himself haranguing a crowd; made another struggle for intelligence,
tried once, twice, to speak, and the third time succeeded:</p>
<p>"Louis'--Louisian'--a--for--ever!" and lay still.</p>
<p>They put those two words on his tomb.</p>
<br>

<h3>WHERE SOME CREOLE MONEY GOES</h3>
<br>
<p>And yet the family committee that ordered the inscription, the
mason who cut it in the marble--himself a sort of half-Grandissime,
half-nobody--and even the fair women who each eve of All-Saints
came, attended by flower-laden slave girls, to lay coronals upon
the old man's tomb, felt, feebly at first, and more and more
distinctly as years went by, that Forever was a trifle long for one
to confine one's patriotic affection to a small fraction of a great
country.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>"And you say your family decline to accept the assistance of the
police in their endeavors to bring the killer of your uncle to
justice?" asked some <i>Am&eacute;ricain</i> or other of 'Polyte
Grandissime.</p>
<p>"'Sir, mie fam'lie do not want to fetch him to justice!--neither
Palmyre! We are goin' to fetch the justice to them! And sir, when
we cannot do that, sir, by ourselves, sir,--no, sir! no
police!"</p>
<p>So Clemence was the only victim of the family wrath; for the
other two were never taken; and it helps our good feeling for the
Grandissimes to know that in later times, under the gentler
influences of a higher civilization, their old Spanish-colonial
ferocity was gradually absorbed by the growth of better traits.
To-day almost all the savagery that can justly be charged against
Louisiana must--strange to say--be laid at the door of the
<i>Am&eacute;ricain</i>. The Creole character has been diluted and
sweetened.</p>
<p>One morning early in September, some two weeks after the death
of Agricola, the same brig which something less than a year before
had brought the Frowenfelds to New Orleans crossed, outward bound,
the sharp line dividing the sometimes tawny waters of Mobile Bay
from the deep blue Gulf, and bent her way toward Europe.</p>
<p>She had two passengers; a tall, dark, wasted yet handsome man of
thirty-seven or thirty-eight years of age, and a woman seemingly
some three years younger, of beautiful though severe countenance;
"very elegant-looking people and evidently rich," so the
brig-master described them,--"had much the look of some of the
Mississippi River 'Lower Coast' aristocracy." Their appearance was
the more interesting for a look of mental distress evident on the
face of each. Brother and sister they called themselves; but, if
so, she was the most severely reserved and distant sister the
master of the vessel had ever seen.</p>
<p>They landed, if the account comes down to us right, at Bordeaux.
The captain, a fellow of the peeping sort, found pastime in keeping
them in sight after they had passed out of his care ashore. They
went to different hotels!</p>
<p>The vessel was detained some weeks in this harbor, and her
master continued to enjoy himself in the way in which he had begun.
He saw his late passengers meet often, in a certain quiet path
under the trees of the Quinconce. Their conversations were low; in
the patois they used they could have afforded to speak louder;
their faces were always grave and almost always troubled. The
interviews seemed to give neither of them any pleasure. The
monsieur grew thinner than ever, and sadly feeble.</p>
<p>"He wants to charter her," the seaman concluded, "but she
doesn't like his rates."</p>
<p>One day, the last that he saw them together, they seemed to be,
each in a way different from the other, under a great strain. He
was haggard, woebegone, nervous; she high-strung, resolute,--with
"eyes that shone like lamps," as said the observer.</p>
<p>"She's a-sendin' him 'way to lew-ard," thought he. Finally the
Monsieur handed her--or rather placed upon the seat near which she
stood, what she would not receive--a folded and sealed document,
seized her hand, kissed it and hurried away. She sank down upon the
seat, weak and pale, and rose to go, leaving the document behind.
The mariner picked it up; it was directed to <i>M. Honor&eacute;
Grandissime, Nouvelle Orl&eacute;ans, &Eacute;tats Unis,
Am&eacute;rique</i>. She turned suddenly, as if remembering, or
possibly reconsidering, and received it from him.</p>
<p>"It looked like a last will and testament," the seaman used to
say, in telling the story.</p>
<p>The next morning, being at the water's edge and seeing a number
of persons gathering about something not far away, he sauntered
down toward it to see how small a thing was required to draw a
crowd of these Frenchmen. It was the drowned body of the f.m.c.</p>
<p>Did the brig-master never see the woman again? He always waited
for this question to be asked him, in order to state the more
impressively that he did. His brig became a regular Bordeaux
packet, and he saw the Madame twice or thrice, apparently living at
great ease, but solitary, in the rue--. He was free to relate that
he tried to scrape acquaintance with her, but failed
ignominiously.</p>
<p>The rents of Number 19 rue Bienville and of numerous other
places, including the new drug-store in the rue Royale, were
collected regularly by H. Grandissime, successor to Grandissime
Fr&egrave;res. Rumor said, and tradition repeats, that neither for
the advancement of a friendless people, nor even for the repair of
the properties' wear and tear, did one dollar of it ever remain in
New Orleans; but that once a year Honor&eacute;, "as instructed,"
remitted to Madame--say Madame Inconnue--of Bordeaux, the
equivalent, in francs, of fifty thousand dollars. It is averred he
did this without interruption for twenty years. "Let us see: fifty
times twenty--one million dollars. That is only a <i>part</i> of
the <i>pecuniary</i> loss which this sort of thing costs
Louisiana."</p>
<p>But we have wandered.</p>

<h3>"ALL RIGHT"</h3>
<br>
<p>The sun is once more setting upon the Place d'Armes. Once more
the shadows of cathedral and town-hall lie athwart the pleasant
grounds where again the city's fashion and beauty sit about in the
sedate Spanish way, or stand or slowly move in and out among the
old willows and along the white walks. Children are again playing
on the sward; some, you may observe, are in black, for Agricola.
You see, too, a more peaceful river, a nearer-seeming and greener
opposite shore, and many other evidences of the drowsy summer's
unwillingness to leave the embrace of this seductive land; the
dreamy quietude of birds; the spreading, folding, re-expanding and
slow pulsating of the all-prevailing fan (how like the unfolding of
an angel's wing is ofttimes the broadening of that little
instrument!); the oft-drawn handkerchief; the pale, cool colors of
summer costume; the swallow, circling and twittering overhead or
darting across the sight; the languid movement of foot and hand;
the reeking flanks and foaming bits of horses; the ear-piercing
note of the cicada; the dancing butterfly; the dog, dropping upon
the grass and looking up to his master with roping jaw and lolling
tongue; the air sweetened with the merchandise of the flower
<i>marchandes</i>.</p>
<p>On the levee road, bridles and saddles, whips, gigs, and
carriages,--what a merry coming and going! We look, perforce,
toward the old bench where, six months ago, sat Joseph Frowenfeld.
There is somebody there--a small, thin, weary-looking man, who
leans his bared head slightly back against the tree, his thin
fingers knit together in his lap, and his chapeau-bras pressed
under his arm. You note his extreme neatness of dress, the bright,
unhealthy restlessness of his eye, and--as a beam from the sun
strikes them--the fineness of his short red curls. It is Doctor
Keene.</p>
<p>He lifts his head and looks forward. Honor&eacute; and
Frowenfeld are walking arm-in-arm under the furthermost row of
willows. Honor&eacute; is speaking. How gracefully, in
correspondence with his words, his free arm or hand--sometimes his
head or even his lithe form--moves in quiet gesture, while the
grave, receptive apothecary takes into his meditative mind, as into
a large, cool cistern, the valued rain-fall of his friend's
communications. They are near enough for the little doctor easily
to call them; but he is silent. The unhappy feel so far away from
the happy. Yet--"Take care!" comes suddenly to his lips, and is
almost spoken; for the two, about to cross toward the Place d'Armes
at the very spot where Aurora had once made her narrow escape, draw
suddenly back, while the black driver of a volante reins up the
horse he bestrides, and the animal himself swerves and stops.</p>
<p>The two friends, though startled apart, hasten with lifted hats
to the side of the volante, profoundly convinced that one, at
least, of its two occupants is heartily sorry that they were not
rolled in the dust. Ah, ah! with what a wicked, ill-stifled
merriment those two ethereal women bend forward in the faintly
perfumed clouds of their ravishing summer-evening garb, to express
their equivocal mortification and regret.</p>
<p>"Oh! I'm so sawry, oh! Almoze runned o'--ah, ha, ha, ha!"</p>
<p>Aurora could keep the laugh back no longer.</p>
<p>"An' righd yeh befo' haivry <i>boddie</i>! Ah, ha, ha! 'Sieur
Grandissime, 'tis <i>me-e-e</i> w'ad know 'ow dad is bad, ha, ha,
ha! Oh! I assu' you, gen'lemen, id is hawful!"</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>By and by Honor&eacute; seemed urging them to do something, the
thought of which made them laugh, yet was entertained as not
entirely absurd. It may have been that to which they presently
seemed to consent; they alighted from the volante, dismissed it,
and walked each at a partner's side down the grassy avenue of the
levee. It was as Clotilde with one hand swept her light robes into
perfect adjustment for the walk, and turned to take the first step
with Frowenfeld, that she raised her eyes for the merest instant to
his, and there passed between them an exchange of glance which made
the heart of the little doctor suddenly burn like a ball of
fire.</p>
<p>"Now we're all right," he murmured bitterly to himself, as,
without having seen him, she took the arm of the apothecary, and
they moved away.</p>
<p>Yes, if his irony was meant for this pair, he divined correctly.
Their hearts had found utterance across the lips, and the future
stood waiting for them on the threshold of a new existence, to
usher them into a perpetual copartnership in all its joys and
sorrows, its disappointments, its imperishable hopes, its aims, its
conflicts, its rewards; and the true--the great--the everlasting
God of love was with them. Yes, it had been "all right," now, for
nearly twenty-four hours--an age of bliss. And now, as they walked
beneath the willows where so many lovers had walked before them,
they had whole histories to tell of the tremors, the dismays, the
misconstructions and longings through which their hearts had come
to this bliss; how at such a time, thus and so; and after such and
such a meeting, so and so; no part of which was heard by alien
ears, except a fragment of Clotilde's speech caught by a small boy
in unintentioned ambush.</p>
<p>"--Evva sinze de firze nighd w'en I big-in to nurze you wid de
fivver."</p>
<p>She was telling him, with that new, sweet boldness so wonderful
to a lately accepted lover, how long she had loved him.</p>
<p>Later on they parted at the <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i>.
Honor&eacute; and Aurora had got there before them, and were
passing on up the stairs. Clotilde, catching, a moment before, a
glimpse of her face, had seen that there was something wrong;
weather-wise as to its indications she perceived an impending
shower of tears. A faint shade of anxiety rested an instant on her
own face. Frowenfeld could not go in. They paused a little within
the obscurity of the corridor, and just to reassure themselves that
everything <i>was</i> "all right," they--</p>
<p>God be praised for love's young dream!</p>
<p>The slippered feet of the happy girl, as she slowly mounted the
stair alone, overburdened with the weight of her blissful reverie,
made no sound. As she turned its mid-angle she remembered Aurora.
She could guess pretty well the source of her trouble;
Honor&eacute; was trying to treat that hand-clasping at the bedside
of Agricola as a binding compact; "which, of course, was not fair."
She supposed they would have gone into the front drawing-room; she
would go into the back. But she miscalculated; as she silently
entered the door she saw Aurora standing a little way beyond her,
close before Honor&eacute;, her eyes cast down, and the trembling
fan hanging from her two hands like a broken pinion. He seemed to
be reiterating, in a tender undertone, some question intended to
bring her to a decision. She lifted up her eyes toward his with a
mute, frightened glance.</p>
<p>The intruder, with an involuntary murmur of apology, drew back;
but, as she turned, she was suddenly and unspeakably saddened to
see Aurora drop her glance, and, with a solemn slowness whose
momentous significance was not to be mistaken, silently shake her
head.</p>
<p>"Alas!" cried the tender heart of Clotilde. "Alas! M.
Grandissime!"</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXI"></a>CHAPTER LXI</h2>
<h3>"NO!"</h3>
<br>
<p>If M. Grandissime had believed that he was prepared for the
supreme bitterness of that moment, he had sadly erred. He could not
speak. He extended his hand in a dumb farewell, when, all
unsanctioned by his will, the voice of despair escaped him in a low
groan. At the same moment, a tinkling sound drew near, and the
room, which had grown dark with the fall of night, began to
brighten with the softly widening light of an evening lamp, as a
servant approached to place it in the front drawing-room.</p>
<p>Aurora gave her hand and withdrew it. In the act the two
somewhat changed position, and the rays of the lamp, as the maid
passed the door, falling upon Aurora's face, betrayed the again
upturned eyes.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Grandissime--"</p>
<p>They fell.</p>
<p>The lover paused.</p>
<p>"You thing I'm crool."</p>
<p>She was the statue of meekness.</p>
<p>"Hope has been cruel to me," replied M. Grandissime, "not you;
that I cannot say. Adieu."</p>
<p>He was turning.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Grandissime--"</p>
<p>She seemed to tremble.</p>
<p>He stood still.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Grandissime,"--her voice was very tender,--"wad you'
horry?"</p>
<p>There was a great silence.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Grandissime, you know--teg a chair."</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment and then both sat down. The servant
repassed the door; yet when Aurora broke the silence, she spoke in
English--having such hazardous things to say. It would conceal
possible stammerings.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Grandissime--you know dad riz'n I--"</p>
<p>She slightly opened her fan, looking down upon it, and was
still.</p>
<p>"I have no right to ask the reason," said M. Grandissime. "It is
yours--not mine."</p>
<p>Her head went lower.</p>
<p>"Well, you know,"--she drooped it meditatively to one side, with
her eyes on the floor,--"'tis bick-ause--'tis bick-ause I thing in
a few days I'm goin' to die."</p>
<p>M. Grandissime said never a word. He was not alarmed.</p>
<p>She looked up suddenly and took a quick breath, as if to resume,
but her eyes fell before his, and she said, in a tone of
half-soliloquy:</p>
<p>"I 'ave so mudge troub' wit dad hawt."</p>
<p>She lifted one little hand feebly to the cardiac region, and
sighed softly, with a dying languor.</p>
<p>M. Grandissime gave no response. A vehicle rumbled by in the
street below, and passed away. At the bottom of the room, where a
gilded Mars was driving into battle, a soft note told the
half-hour. The lady spoke again.</p>
<p>"Id mague"--she sighed once more--"so strange,--sometime' I
thing I'm git'n' crezzy."</p>
<p>Still he to whom these fearful disclosures were being made
remained as silent and motionless as an Indian captive, and, after
another pause, with its painful accompaniment of small sounds, the
fair speaker resumed with more energy, as befitting the approach to
an incredible climax:</p>
<p>"Some day', 'Sieur Grandissime,--id mague me fo'gid my hage! I
thing I'm young!"</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes with the evident determination to meet his
own squarely, but it was too much; they fell as before; yet she
went on speaking:</p>
<p>"An' w'en someboddie git'n' ti'ed livin' wid 'imsev an' big'n'
to fill ole, an' wan' someboddie to teg de care of 'im an' wan' me
to gid marri'd wid 'im--I thing 'e's in love to me." Her fingers
kept up a little shuffling with the fan. "I thing I'm crezzy. I
thing I muz be go'n' to die torecklie." She looked up to the
ceiling with large eyes, and then again at the fan in her lap,
which continued its spreading and shutting. "An' daz de riz'n,
'Sieur Grandissime." She waited until it was certain he was about
to answer, and then interrupted him nervously: "You know, 'Sieur
Grandissime, id woon be righd! Id woon be de juztiz to <i>you!</i>
An' you de bez man I evva know in my life, 'Sieur Grandissime!" Her
hands shook. "A man w'at nevva wan' to gid marri'd wid noboddie in
'is life, and now trine to gid marri'd juz only to rip-ose de soul
of 'is oncl'--"</p>
<p>M. Grandissime uttered an exclamation of protest, and she
ceased.</p>
<p>"I asked you," continued he, with low-toned emphasis, "for the
single and only reason that I want you for my wife."</p>
<p>"Yez," she quickly replied; "daz all. Daz wad I thing. An' I
thing daz de rad weh to say, 'Sieur Grandissime. Bick-ause, you
know, you an' me is too hole to talg aboud dad <i>lovin'</i>, you
know. An' you godd dad grade <i>rizpeg</i> fo' me, an' me I godd
dad 'ighez rispeg fo' you; bud--" she clutched the fan and her face
sank lower still--"bud--" she swallowed--shook her head--"bud--"
She bit her lip; she could not go on.</p>
<p>"Aurora," said her lover, bending forward and taking one of her
hands. "I <i>do</i> love you with all my soul."</p>
<p>She made a poor attempt to withdraw her hand, abandoned the
effort, and looked up savagely through a pair of overflowing eyes,
demanding:</p>
<p>"<i>Mais</i>, fo' w'y you di' n' wan' to sesso?"</p>
<p>M. Grandissime smiled argumentatively.</p>
<p>"I have said so a hundred times, in every way but in words."</p>
<p>She lifted her head proudly, and bowed like a queen.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais</i>, you see 'Sieur Grandissime, you bin meg one
mizteg."</p>
<p>"Bud 'tis corrected in time," exclaimed he, with suppressed but
eager joyousness.</p>
<p>"'Sieur Grandissime," she said, with a tremendous solemnity,
"I'm verrie sawrie; <i>mais</i>--you spogue too lade."</p>
<p>"No, no!" he cried, "the correction comes in time. Say that,
lady; say that!"</p>
<p>His ardent gaze beat hers once more down; but she shook her
head. He ignored the motion.</p>
<p>"And you will correct your answer; ah! say that, too!" he
insisted, covering the captive hand with both his own, and leaning
forward from his seat.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais</i>, 'Sieur Grandissime, you know, dad is so verrie
unegspeg'."</p>
<p>"Oh! unexpected!"</p>
<p>"<i>Mais</i>, I was thing all dad time id was Clotilde wad
you--"</p>
<p>She turned her face away and buried her mouth in her
handkerchief.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he cried, "mock me no more, Aurore Nancanou!"</p>
<p>He rose erect and held the hand firmly which she strove to draw
away:</p>
<p>"Say the word, sweet lady; say the word!"</p>
<p>She turned upon him suddenly, rose to her feet, was speechless
an instant while her eyes flashed into his, and crying out:</p>
<p>"No!" burst into tears, laughed through them, and let him clasp
her to his bosom.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
